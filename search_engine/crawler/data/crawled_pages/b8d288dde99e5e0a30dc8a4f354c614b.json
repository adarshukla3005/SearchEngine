Saloi A few years back I got obsessed with Poker, and spent all my post work hours watching Twitch streams of players. Read like a dozen books. And yes, played every day till early morning. I have the same interest in crypto today. All I do is watch crypto content and read newsletters. Crypto is like a game at this point. Like what Poker was. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. Trying to figure it out. I will be honest, the only reason I am not as involved in this space is because I am scared of regulatory uncertanties. If I was in Singapore/Dubai, I would have invested a lot more. Maybe even joined a web3 startup. For example, I know I can use a VPN and play Poker, even though my state government has banned it. But I don‚Äôt do that. I don‚Äôt want to add complexity in my life. Confession: I have not made much money from crypto. My holding is pretty small. I don‚Äôt even check my Binance account. I will never shill Laxmi NFTs to you.
