Saloi Lending is a feature. A lot of standalone lending apps died in India because eventually all the Fintech companies realised that lending (and maybe selling insurance) is the only way to monetise.

The more products someone uses in the Figma ecosystem, the more their workflow is tied to the Figma ecosystem, the higher the retention rate.
