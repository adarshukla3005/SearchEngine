Saloi The AI video gen products are messy. Heygen has probably the largest collection of AI avatars, but the generated videos look ‚ÄúAI‚Äù and not human. Captions AI is decent, probably the only one that has been able to generate videos that can be uploaded on socials to shill products. But zero shot prompting does not always give accurate results. Then you need Capcut (which does not even work in India) to stitch together app screenshots and the AI-generated video. This is not easy. Current workflow for most AI wrappers: US app builder -> US TikTok influencer -> US influencer charges up to $5 CPM -> There are so many internal workflows to manage these influencers -> Grow Manageable workflow: Indian app builder -> European influencer of fiver -> Get video -> US phone + TikTok -> Pray If the opex is the same (essentially infra + some LLM), then you want to sell to the US audience, which has the highest LTV. Indians don‚Äôt pay, except for quick commerce, and more than that see yesterday‚Äôs GDP growth numbers. Ideal workflow: Indian app builder -> Build any AI wrapper -> (You use Styletransfergen -> Get clips -> TikTokpostingworkflownew) -> Grow Styletransfergen‚Äôs product flow will be similar to Captions AI. But instead of text -> video prompt, it lets the app builder create a video however they want -> lets you choose AI avatars -> AI avatar uses the same style, hand gestures, script, including pauses to create a human video instead of a clear AI looking video. Currently there are reels where you can see this. Brad Pitt‚Äôs face superimposed on some guy‚Äôs face. But again, it looks AI-generated. Tiktokpostingworkflownew -> Maybe it is an agency. Maybe it is a marketplace that buys US phones -> installs TikTok -> warms up the account. And then starts posting your videos. Why TikTok and not Reels? TikTok is still the original slot machine. On Reels, it is difficult for one-off videos to take off. Comparatively easier on TikTok. We tried getting an iPhone flashed -> install only TikTok -> take US e-sim/ use VPN -> Poast workflow. You just get shadow banned. Why can‚Äôt Indian app builders publish their own videos for an Indian audience? If you are building Astrotalk then sure. If you are building an AI wrapper then look at the opex comment and the GDP growth comment. The first part of the workflow is still important, even if you figure out the TikTok workflow. You need a European looking AI girl/guy to shill your wrapper. And style transfer is what will work. Text -> Video prompt products are again like playing with a slot machine, and there are limited types of videos you can create with the limited AI actors and backgrounds available in Captions AI today. There should also be more templates in the product. Especially the ones that start on TikTok. Maybe even music. More backgrounds for AI. Backgrounds are not hard, you just need to take videos of more environments. You should not have to go to Capcut for more editing. If this workflow becomes possible, there will be dozens of AI calorie counters, voice note products, AI video clippers, transcription apps flooding the App Store. And India‚Äôs GDP will be 7% again.", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\"><head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n  <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\"><!-- Begin Jekyll SEO tag v2.8.0 -->\n<title>The new AI wrapper products pipeline | Manas J.
