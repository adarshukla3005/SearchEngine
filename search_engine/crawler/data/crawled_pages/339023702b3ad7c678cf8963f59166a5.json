Saloi Yes, everyone‚Äôs seem to be losing their minds over the job posting. 20 lakhs to apply. Yes, you read that right. You pay Deepinder to work for him. And the internet is having a field day. A lot of memes. A lot of outrage. And a few ex Zomato employees defending Deepinder and calling this the opportunity of a lifetime. But let‚Äôs take a step back. What is Deepinder, Zomato‚Äôs founder, actually trying to achieve here? It all boils down to success metrics, as it always does. Deepinder‚Äôs probably thinking: Hire an absolute A-player. Someone who‚Äôs ready to work insane hours. This isn‚Äôt new. The last COS posting also emphasized ‚Äúno WLB‚Äù (work-life balance) and ‚Äúextreme long hours.‚Äù Someone with serious skin in the game. If you‚Äôre coughing up 20 lakhs just for a chance, you‚Äôre going to give it your all. No slacking, no half-hearted attempts. So, how does he get this unicorn of an employee? Let‚Äôs break it down: Distribution: The first COS post was wild. This one‚Äôs even wilder. Everyone in the tech world, and probably their grandmothers, have heard about it. Mission accomplished on getting eyeballs. Self-Selection: This is where it gets interesting. You‚Äôre not going to get 10,000 applicants. Maybe 1,000, and that‚Äôs probably a stretch. But these 1,000 will be the ones who are seriously considering this insane proposition. They‚Äôve already bought into the idea, at least a little. Is this a win for Deepinder? Let‚Äôs revisit those success metrics: A-Player: This is tricky. This kind of post automatically turns off a lot of top-tier talent. If you‚Äôre good enough to be considered for this role, you probably already have offers in the 50L-1Cr range. Why would you give that up and pay 20 lakhs instead? Many COS roles are filled by post-MBA consultants. They‚Äôre already drowning in student loans. Is this even remotely appealing to them? So, yeah, the pool gets smaller, and not necessarily in a good way. Long Hours and Skin in the Game: Now, this is where it gets interesting. That Bain consultant making 75 LPA might still consider the COS role, but will they hustle as hard as someone who‚Äôs paying 20 lakhs instead of drawing a 75L salary? Probably not. The person paying 20 lakhs is basically betting their career on this. The stakes are much higher. A lot of Twitter folks are saying this will just attract rich, privileged kids, maybe some ex-Ashoka types. And that Deepinder will miss out on genuinely talented individuals who can‚Äôt afford this gamble. Maybe there is some truth in that. Who would actually do this? If you‚Äôre a high-risk, high-reward kind of person, willing to put in the crazy hours, and skilled enough to get selected, think about what you get: Direct access to one of the most successful founders of our generation: You‚Äôll see how Deepinder operates up close and personal. Network: You‚Äôll likely have access to his network and even his inbox. Most people have to rely on Internal Tech Emails‚Äô Twitter account to read CEO memos. Deepinder will be as invested as you are: He‚Äôs facing major backlash on social media. He‚Äôs not going to let this fail. Most roles are one-sided. You‚Äôre trying to impress some C-level exec while being a number in HR‚Äôs spreadsheet. This will be very, very different. What‚Äôs actually going to happen? Most Likely: Deepinder hires some ex-consultant, and the internet forgets about this in a week. Just like the last COS post. Wild Card: Someone makes an incredible pitch on Twitter or LinkedIn and gets the job without paying the 20 lakhs. This would be the ultimate PR move. What I don‚Äôt get: Why not hire internally? Zomato‚Äôs known for its intense culture and high churn. Not everyone can handle the pressure or the insane hours. Someone from Ops or Strategy who‚Äôs been there for a year or two would be perfect. But, hey, Zomato does Zomato things. And they‚Äôve got Twitter talking, which is probably what they wanted all along. This whole thing is a fascinating case study. Is it brilliant or completely bonkers? Only time will tell.", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\"><head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n  <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\"><!-- Begin Jekyll SEO tag v2.8.0 -->\n<title>Zomato COS: Pay to play | Manas J.
