I should not have played so much poker without studying my competition first. I was distracted. Multi tabling. Did not take the game seriously enough while everyone was targeting me. Bank roll: I did not have the bankroll of other players. I saw people go down 20K for the night and coming back again. I should have not played only if I was afraid of losing my bankroll.
