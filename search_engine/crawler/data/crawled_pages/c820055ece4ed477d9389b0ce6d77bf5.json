Saloi I did not set any goals for 2021. I am a person who is obsessed with systems and lives his life through daily habits and yearly OKRs. So this was new for me. I wanted to see if I change how I live my day if I don’t set any goals. Would I read less? Would I try out more new things? What were the things I would cut out from my life that I was doing out of sheer habit? What would be the new additions to my life? Instead of OKRs with timelines, I created a list of things I wanted to do for 2021 if I got time. I did not obsess over this list. I did not even check it out every week. If I was bored and wanted ideas I would look at the list for inspiration. Instead of updating my personal OKRs list monthly like the years before, I just created a note where I captured what I did during the year. Anything that was important to me went into it. Oh yeah, somewhere during the middle of the year, I did write down my priorities for the year because I kept doing too many things and wanted to see if what I was doing mapped to the things that I had identified as a priority. I identified these as my 3 biggest priorities for 2021 Health (physical and mental) Career Understand crypto Let’s see how it went. 2021 recap: Writing: 185 posts (original blogposts as well as book summaries.) Reading: ~110 books, average page size of 275. Worked on a lot of high impact projects at work. 100+ people attended private sessions on career and product management.

Started board games nights with my wife. April Gifted a new phone to my brother. First board games day with friends. Read more Poker theory. Was playing in a group that had past WSOP players. So had to up my game. May Played a lot of heads-up Poker with people far superior to me. Started German lessons. A long term goal is to live in Europe at some point of my life. Gave up on this endeavor after a month’s effort though. Shipped La luna poker tournament and won 1.5L over a night. Wrapped up adda52 tournament journey after getting burned out. Got vaccinated. Won division 1 championship in Fifa 21 twice. Finished succession 1 and 2. One of the best things I watched in 2021. Stopped daily poker. Post this the frequency went down to once a month session with friends in person. June Completed Fiction masterclass by Neil Gaiman. Started using Vocab builder apps. Gave up after a week. Started a podcast on Mahabharata by Sudipta Bhawmik. Highly recommend this. My wife got into puzzles and just did puzzles for a month. Started intermittent fasting. Did not work out for me.

Invested in Cred Mint. Got a 5/5 rating in my performance review. I had always got 4/5 (Exceeds Expectations). This was the first time I got Outstanding. :Feels good man meme: Bought my first tokens: Bitcoin, Etherium, and Matic. My crypto portfolio allocation is less than my one month’s rent. I bought these to understand the ecosystem. So please don’t take anything I write on crypto as investment advice. September Wrote my first blogpost on crypto, now renamed as web3. Most of my blogposts in H2 would be focused on web3. Bought my own poker set. Completed the Learn Cryptocurrency course by Preethi Kasireddy. Got bored midway and mostly skimmed though. Completed David Parrel’s free course on Writing. Bought first US stocks. I am increasing my US exposure massively. Most of my holdings (passive or active is US equities, either through ETFs or direct stock purchase through Indmoney.) October Got promoted to Group Product Manager. Visited my wife’s family in Coimbatore. Started football training with a proper coach. Could not do more than 2 sessions with him as I broke my elbow playing football with the bois. Got into graphic novels. Spent the entire month reading just that. Gifted an iPad to my father in law. Visited a temple. I identified as an atheist for most of my life, but lately have started following the traditions of my religion in an attempt to get more spiritual. November We learned how to make good curd. The idea is to use full fat milk instead. I was so happy that I ate curd rice for weeks. Gifted sunglasses to my wife. She never had ones that fit, so we were super happy when she found something that did. Invested a small check in my friend’s startup. A lot of inbound came this year, but I am not willing to double down on it till I think I have an edge. Spending most of my networth just to update my bio as angel investor is negative ROI. Helped a bunch of startups (mostly started by friends.) Gifted Galaxy S20 FE to my dad. Got a big stock grant. Now most of my network is tied to illiquid private market stocks. December Updated my wife’s website. I had created the site way back in January, but never got the chance to make it “look pretty.” I also updated own website, especially the Uses this page. First proper vacation in 3 years since I joined my current company. First vacation with my wife since I met her 4 years back. I tried to stay off Slack, but failed. I attended calls only one day during the week I was in Goa, so I would count it as a positive. Bought an iPhone Pro and Airpods Pro for myself. Got Skillshare yearly subscription. Completed 2 photography courses on Skillshare. Gifted ETFs and MFs to my brother. Random Reflections: I kept doing the same things that I have always done. Just because I did not set a Goodreads goal did not mean I read less. Just because I did not set up analytics on my blog (to get dopamine hits), I did not write fewer posts. Should have SIPed instead of trying to time the market by investing during dips. Lost out on a lot of the upside. I have set up SIPs from Jan’22. I am planning to create my own money rules. I could have travelled more. A lot of my frinds utilised the WFH period by spending months working out of Goa/ Himachal. Should have doubled down on buying individual stocks I really believe in. I knew FANG stocks were undervalued. I kept buying N100 instead. Chose the safer option. Could have bought more crypto, but getting my HDFC UPI blocked due to P2P transactions scared me and I did not bother post that. Mostly lazyness on my part. Met a lot of interesting people. Got deep into the crypto rabbithole. Wrote 10+ posts on web3. A lot of my money habits are tied to loss aversion. Something I will be working on in the future. Started tracking my daily habits far more aggressively this year. I am not getting any younger. Health has the biggest correlation to happiness and I need to take it seriously. Plan to travel more in 2022 if possible. I will continue taking personal training for the things I want to get better at. Seeing so many friends move abroad, Europe and US, did make me think a lot about my career and life choices; about whether I am making the right decision to stay back here. I spent a lot of mental energy on figuring out what I really want out of my life, whether I can get it while living in India. I don’t want to make decisions based on FOMO. I love learning new things. I get excited whenever I do a new course and learn some new skill. I am planning to do a lot more courses in 2022. I spent way more time shitposting on Twitter than I intended. Failure to cut down my Twitter has been one of the biggest failures of 2021. I loved tracking my monthly highlights this year. It is the best way of me remembering what happened during 2021. The highlights I put also implicitly shows what I care about the most. With covid not going anywhere, time will continue to fly by and every day will feel the same. Even more so if you are in your late 20s/early 30s. Ask yourself what you did this March? Do you remember anything at all? This reflection is mostly for me and hence I won’t share this on Twitter. Hope this inspires you to write your own. Want to do your own year end reflections?

Spending most of my networth just to update my bio as angel investor is negative ROI.</li>\n  <li>Helped a bunch of startups (mostly started by friends.)</li>\n  <li>Gifted Galaxy S20 FE to my dad.</li>\n  <li>Got a big stock grant. Now most of my network is tied to illiquid private market stocks.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>December</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Updated my wife’s website. I had created the site way back in January, but never got the chance to make it “look pretty.”</li>\n  <li>I also updated own website, especially the Uses this page.</li>\n  <li>First proper vacation in 3 years since I joined my current company. First vacation with my wife since I met her 4 years back. I tried to stay off Slack, but failed. I attended calls only one day during the week I was in Goa, so I would count it as a positive.</li>\n  <li>Bought an iPhone Pro and Airpods Pro for myself.</li>\n  <li>Got Skillshare yearly subscription.</li>\n  <li>Completed 2 photography courses on Skillshare.</li>\n  <li>Gifted ETFs and MFs to my brother.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Random Reflections:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>I kept doing the same things that I have always done. Just because I did not set a Goodreads goal did not mean I read less. Just because I did not set up analytics on my blog (to get dopamine hits), I did not write fewer posts.</li>\n  <li>Should have SIPed instead of trying to time the market by investing during dips. Lost out on a lot of the upside. I have set up SIPs from Jan’22.</li>\n  <li>I am planning to create my <a href=\"https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/money-rules/\">own money rules.</a></li>\n  <li>I could have travelled more. A lot of my frinds utilised the WFH period by spending months working out of Goa/ Himachal.</li>\n  <li>Should have doubled down on buying individual stocks I really believe in. I knew FANG stocks were undervalued. I kept buying N100 instead. Chose the safer option.</li>\n  <li>Could have bought more crypto, but getting my HDFC UPI blocked due to P2P transactions scared me and I did not bother post that. Mostly lazyness on my part.</li>\n  <li>Met a lot of interesting people.</li>\n  <li>Got deep into the crypto rabbithole. Wrote 10+ posts on web3.</li>\n  <li>A lot of my money habits are tied to loss aversion. Something I will be working on in the future.</li>\n  <li>Started tracking my daily habits far more aggressively this year. I am not getting any younger. Health has the biggest correlation to happiness and I need to take it seriously.</li>\n  <li>Plan to travel more in 2022 if possible.</li>\n  <li>I will continue taking personal training for the things I want to get better at.</li>\n  <li>Seeing so many friends move abroad, Europe and US, did make me think a lot about my career and life choices; about whether I am making the right decision to stay back here. I spent a lot of mental energy on figuring out what I really want out of my life, whether I can get it while living in India. I don’t want to make decisions based on FOMO.</li>\n  <li>I love learning new things. I get excited whenever I do a new course and learn some new skill. I am planning to do a lot more courses in 2022.</li>\n  <li>I spent way more time shitposting on Twitter than I intended. Failure to cut down my Twitter has been one of the biggest failures of 2021.</li>\n  <li>I loved tracking my monthly highlights this year. It is the best way of me remembering what happened during 2021. The highlights I put also implicitly shows what I care about the most.</li>\n  <li>With covid not going anywhere, time will continue to fly by and every day will feel the same. Even more so if you are in your late 20s/early 30s. Ask yourself what you did this March? Do you remember anything at all?</li>\n  <li>This reflection is mostly for me and hence I won’t share this on Twitter. Hope this inspires you to write your own.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Want to do your own year end reflections?
