No more fancy meetups, no more ‚Äúwhat are you working on‚Äù conversations, no more startup ecosystem drama. If work wasn‚Äôt my identity anymore, how many people from my current circle would actually stay in touch? Not asking for LinkedIn engagement or Twitter DMs. Just genuine ‚Äúhey, how are you doing‚Äù calls. People who‚Äôd want to talk because they enjoy our conversations, not because there‚Äôs something to gain or lose.

Maybe I‚Äôm being cynical. Maybe I‚Äôm overthinking. But these thoughts hit different during December when everyone is posting their year-end achievements and goals for next year. Not that I‚Äôm planning to move to Hubli tomorrow. But it‚Äôs a good thought experiment. Makes you think about what really matters, who really matters.
