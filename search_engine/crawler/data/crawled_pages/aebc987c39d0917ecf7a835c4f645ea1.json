Saloi One important thing to consider for B2C founders: Ask when will people use my product. The cost to creation is at an all time low thanks to AI, but people have enough products for their dopamine addiction. Are users using your new AI driven metaverse app when they are commuting to office instead of scrolling reels on Instagram? Are they listening to your AI driven text to audio app instead of podcasts when they are working out? People don‚Äôt just adopt new apps just because they are cool - yes, they will try them out maybe, but long term adoption happens only because they fit into an existing behavior or replace an old behavior more effectively. If your product doesn‚Äôt have a clear time slot in people‚Äôs routines, it‚Äôs likely to be ignored. For B2B founders: It is about figuring out how your product will integrate in a team‚Äôs workflow. Yes, your AI recruiter is cool, but recruiters are already on Lever. So are you complementing Lever, how does your product integrate in their workflow? Are you replacing Lever or are you building a complement? Focus on solution is nice, but understanding the current workflow of your customers is even more important. Workflow understanding > Problem - Solution fit. A product isn‚Äôt useful unless it replaces or fits into an existing habit/workflow. (I have talked to a dozen founders last week. This is probably the thing that came up most often.)", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\"><head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n  <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\"><!-- Begin Jekyll SEO tag v2.8.0 -->\n<title>When will people use your product? | Manas J.
