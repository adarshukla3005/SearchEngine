What I do to write more: Dump all my thoughts on Twitter threads: Unfiltered ramblings just to get out my thoughts on a topic. Then I copy paste the thread content on a draft email. All my draft posts are on gmail. People think I spend a lot of time writing online, be it on Twitter or my blog. It is not true. I have been writing online for 10+ years. Started with a campus satire blog called Tamatar News. Once something becomes a habit, it is very easy to do it on autopilot without thinking about it. Thought dump on Inkpad. I use Inkpad for notetaking. I keep thinking about all sorts of topics. I will have an idea about how to build a new on demand marketplace at midnight, and considering I don‚Äôt have access to Twitter to thought dump then, I would just add it to Inkpad. Take notes whenever I am consuming podcasts/articles/books. Turn templates I use at work into blogposts. Add notes from interesting discussions I have with friends and mentors. When I am feeling lazy, I use voice notes. Thought dumping and editing happens in separate sessions. Hence you will see me add threads I wrote weeks back into blogposts much later. Focus on reducing friction in my writing process. If I plan to sit and write a post, I know I will never get it done. So I find it easier to just dump all my thoughts without worrying about the end result. Accept your strengths help. I know that I will never have the patience or rigor to write like Ben Thompson. Hence I default to what I call ‚Äúunfiltered thoughts.‚Äù These can be thought of as rough notes for myself. My writing style is also pretty simple. Once I post a blogpost, I might edit it based on feedback from friends. Hate proofreading. So all posts will have typos and grammatical errors. I fix them ove time. Most of my posts are thoughtdumps. Hence I sometimes overshare info about my personal life/ feel guilty about writing on some sensitive topic/ get too blunt. In those cases I just edit my writings later. All my posts are live posts. I keep adding more content/editing them for years. I overindex on getting something I wrote out fast. Use bullet points because figuring out structure of a post is too much effort. People think I spend a lot of time writing online, be it on Twitter or my blog. It is not true. I have been writing online for 10+ years. Started with a campus satire blog called Tamatar News. Once something becomes a habit, it is very easy to do it on autopilot without thinking about it. Writing a shit post: One minute. 5 shit posts a day = 5 minutes. A thread (mostly unplanned, based on vibe and something that is more of a thought dump): 15 mins. Turning the thread into a post: Another 15 mins. Total time = Less than an hour everyday. I honestly spend far more time getting pissed off at replies from people who come to argue with me online, but that is another story.", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\"><head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n  <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\"><!-- Begin Jekyll SEO tag v2.8.0 -->\n<title>How to write 100+ blogposts a year | Manas J.
