This is a discussion that will never happen on Twitter. And the reason why I never comment on anyone‚Äôs tweet. And rarely engage with replies on my own tweets. It is pointless. Every time I have changed my own opinion on something, and that has happened a lot, it has come from hours of intense debate with someone I respect. Or by reading and thinking a lot on that topic. I had a 2 hour discussion with a friend who had immigrated to Canada and just got his citizenship recently. We discussed our career and also a lot of our recent life choices. It was illuminating. I even wrote a post on it. Being opinionated means that I do attract a lot of similiarly strongly opinionated friends. All of them with different views on life and career. A lot of the learnings contradict themselves. And it is fine.
