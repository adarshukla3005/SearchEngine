You can find my notes below: Position of the subject is important, but equally important is the position of the photgrapher. Perspective: low angle, high angle, lateral movement, 1st POV. Try all angles. Vantage points: point of focus through lateral lines, geometric and organic. Shoot through something. Rule of thirds. Use background as 2nd subject. Use dead space. Show ground to give perception of depth. Light: into light, with light, sideways. Utilise the light. Golden hour is best. Always think framing. Use the environment. Fill the frame. Everything in the frame should be part of a story you are telling. Take multiple shots. Pay attention to the borders of your frame. Keep focus on the subject. Ask what you want your image to say before you decide how to say it. Think what everybody does. Do the opposite for an unique perspective. Shoot landscape mode more. You can always turn it into portrait if needed. Storytelling: hero vs what lies ahead, hero vs the world, I am too cool, follow me. Combination: vantage point + high angle.", "content": "Notes on photography | Manas J.
