Saloi The future of content and AI is going to be wild, and nobody is talking about it enough. I was watching this episode of the My First Million podcast, and they were talking about these 1-minute serialized video reels. You know, the kind you see all over Instagram. Basically, TikTok dramas. I‚Äôve seen a ton of them, and I know they‚Äôre huge in China. I know people who‚Äôve actually paid to watch them.They‚Äôre always about some crazy, over-the-top storyline. Like, the boss falling for his secretary, or someone getting dissed by their rich relatives. But then there‚Äôs a twist ‚Äì the guy getting humiliated turns out to be a secret billionaire. Forbidden love, revenge, the whole nine yards. It‚Äôs basically like those Chetan Bhagat novels or those Ekta Kapoor TV shows, but instead of stretching a scene for half an hour with five different camera angles, the story moves at lightning speed. Same actors, different shows. It‚Äôs wild.And it got me thinking. With AI video generators like Sora and Kling getting better every day, it‚Äôs not hard to imagine some dude in Hanumangarh pumping out these videos and making bank. I mean, yeah, you need consistency with the characters and more control over the video instead of just generating a single shot, but this feels like the first big way to make money with video generation. Forget about making entire movies ‚Äì that‚Äôs probably still a decade away. This is something that could happen much sooner. Speaking of regional content going global - Black Myth: Wukong showed that if you take a regional story and execute it well, the whole world will pay attention. I won‚Äôt be surprised if we see a AAA game based on the Mahabharata or Ramayana in the next 10 years. Sure, we might not have the game dev talent today, but as AI makes game development cheaper and faster, these IPs become more accessible. Just imagine playing as Arjuna in the Kurukshetra war or Hanuman leaping across the ocean to Lanka. The education space is also going to change dramatically. Forget about White Hat Jr with their call center teachers reading from scripts. Imagine AI tuition centers where both your teacher and classmates are AI. The AI teacher adapts to your learning style, your AI classmates ask questions you‚Äôre too scared to ask, and nobody judges you for being slow. You will have your copilot for interviewing who will be managing your own personal job-hunting army. They will help you through the entire application process. You tell your copilot what kind of jobs you want, and it orchestrates everything - one agent crawls job sites, another tailors your CV, another one applies, and another handles interview scheduling. The whole ‚Äúspray and pray‚Äù approach to job applications will be replaced by targeted, personalized outreach at scale. VR is about to get interesting too. The Oculus 3 costs as much as a cheap Android phone now. Meta is desperate for content. There‚Äôs never been a better time to build VR apps. Imagine a game where you‚Äôre Oberyn Martell fighting the Mountain in the Colosseum. (Though hopefully with a better ending for Oberyn this time.) The future is going to be weird. But it‚Äôs also going to be full of opportunities. And I, for one, am excited to see what happens next.", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\"><head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n  <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\"><!-- Begin Jekyll SEO tag v2.8.0 -->\n<title>AI product ideas | Manas J.
