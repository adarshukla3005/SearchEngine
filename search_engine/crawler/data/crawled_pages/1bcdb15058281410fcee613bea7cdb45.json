I thought: How can I spend more than 50,000 a month? It was impossible to do. I had one room in a 2 BHK flat. I didn’t eat out that much. I hadn’t really got into the Apple ecosystem. And yes, I did not understand the concept of inflation at all. I could have easily afforded a much better house. But I always preferred to live well below my means. And maintain a lifestyle that was recession-proof. My rent is now ~47K a month. That is 3/4 of what it was 5 years ago. Rent in Bangalore has also gone up significantly. But it is still a lot less than what most of my friends are paying as rent in Bangalore. I also live in Murugeshpalya. I do not live in the Defence Colony in Indiranagar. Can I afford to pay more? Sure. There’s no need to do that. I have always been happy to live a life of low (er) status. At least in comparison to my peers/friends. I do not own a house. I don’t have a car of my own. I can probably afford to have both of them. Don’t want to. Tech bro salaries are a good way to boost your savings. But if you inflate your lifestyle too much and increase your recurring expenses too much, you become a slave to that high-paying job. I am happy to spend more on one-off expenses: holidays, purchases of things that give me short-term pleasure, but I am also happy to downgrade if I ever have to live on a lower budget. I am happy to spend more on a hotel room from time to time, while I am perfectly happy to stay in a cheap hostel if I have to. I get the same amount of pleasure from both. And I don’t even have an Instagram account. So who knows where I’ve been on my holiday? My only worry: getting into debt, maybe finally getting sucked into buying a flat in Bengaluru, and EMI tying me to a high paying job. Recurring expenses worry me.
