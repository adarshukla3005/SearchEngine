The opex of the tier-1 companies from India that have gone public in the recent past is a lot of offline costs.

Own the underlying asset. Roll up hospitals. Call centres. Cut costs by using AI. Take more risks. Now everything has changed with deepseek and the step change of lower cost and the ability to adopt open source. Low LTV, price sensitivity of users, and lower free to pay conversion in India doesn‚Äôt matter as much when CAC and opex is low too.
