Saloi So I was scrolling Reddit and stumbled upon this thing about Zepto doing differential pricing: charging people different prices for the same stuff. But get this - it‚Äôs based on the price of your phone. Seriously? Like, what is this, amateur hour? If you‚Äôre gonna do differential pricing, at least do it right. Go big or go home. Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd do it: Phone Model: Obviously, right? iPhone 15 Pro Max? You‚Äôre paying extra. Older, smaller screen? Still paying extra, but maybe a little less. Location: This is a no-brainer. Defence Colony folks can afford to pay more. Murugeshpalya, maybe not so much. Society: Living in Adarsh Palm Retreat? Yeah, you‚Äôre definitely paying a premium. Credit Card: HDFC Infinia? Get ready to shell out more. Floor Number: Higher floor = higher price. Simple as that. View: This is where it gets interesting. Diamond District, but your view is of a nala? Discount for you. Agara Lake view? Cha-ching! Pool view in your society? Pay up. Peer Group: Your contact list is full of high-rollers? You‚Äôre one of them now, at least in terms of pricing. Battery Percentage: Low battery? You‚Äôre desperate. And desperate people pay more. Charge your phone, then order. Life Stage: Just had a baby? Congrats! Now you‚Äôre paying the convenience tax. Because, let‚Äôs face it, you‚Äôre not going anywhere anytime soon. But why stop at device data? Let‚Äôs get the delivery guys involved. They‚Äôre already going to your house, right? The Delivery Guy Audit: They deliver your stuff, and while they‚Äôre at it, they fill out a quick form on the driver app. How do you look? What‚Äôs your house like? Can they peek into your living room? Based on that, they can categorize you: loaded, middle class, poor. Easy peasy. The Maintenance Fee Guessing Game: Delivery guys should also guess your society‚Äôs maintenance fees. Just another data point to fine-tune that pricing. Workplace Intel: You tagged your location as ‚Äúwork‚Äù? Where do you work? Appraisal season just ended? How‚Äôd it go? People happy? Prices go up. Your company just raised a ton of money? You‚Äôre paying more. Engineering department? You guys are paying more than customer support. Layoffs? Okay, maybe you get a discount. Look, if you‚Äôre not doing all of this, you‚Äôre leaving money on the table. It‚Äôs as simple as that. Zepto, you‚Äôve got some catching up to do. And maybe, just maybe, this whole thing is a joke.
