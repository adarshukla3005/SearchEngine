But under Jassy’s leadership, Amazon has not only sustained its momentum but accelerated. In this wide-ranging conversation with HBR’s editor at large, Jassy reflects on what it takes to get a behemoth like Amazon to operate like a startup and how he pushes his team to take chances. “If you aren’t failing,” he says, “you’re either not inventing enough or not pushing the envelope.” He explains his decision to get workers back to the office five days a week, why he’s working to flatten the organization, and how Amazon is embracing AI. An optimist by nature, Jassy predicts that AI will transform the customer experience, but he’s clear-eyed about the challenges that accompany rapid technological change.","content_snippet":"“Speed Is a Leadership Decision”SKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoLeadership“Speed Is a Lea"},"0063bfffc9074f8c07b572d24cd98b7e":{"url":"https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly","title":"Technology Quarterly | The Economist","description":"Technology Quarterly from The Economist.

Incivility on the job is getting worse, and each day it costs companies billions in lost productivity and absenteeism. To navigate the discord, today’s business leaders need to develop conflict intelligence, writes Coleman, a Columbia professor and expert on conflict resolution. Like emotional intelligence, conflict intelligence involves empathy, self-regulation, and social awareness, but it also includes situational awareness and understanding the social dynamics and systemic forces that influence disputes. Drawing examples from the work of peacemakers, diplomats, and business executives, Coleman highlights seven strategies that conflict-intelligent leaders use to manage volatile situations: laying the groundwork for better communication and trust, fostering collaborative relationships through meaningful joint ventures, balancing firmness with creative solutions, using adaptive approaches, leveraging the broader context, investing in the long term, and being opportunistic. Leaders who use these tactics do more than tamp down disagreements, Coleman notes. They also create company cultures where employees feel more safe, satisfied, and creative and can handle uncertainty and stress better.","content_snippet":"The Conflict-Intelligent LeaderSKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoLeadershipThe Conflict-Int"},"02b678321e14273ff3340d290fa4f1ae":{"url":"https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/tag/open-source","title":"Blog | Linux Foundation | Open Source","description":"Open Source | Check out Linux Foundation's Blog","content_snippet":"Blog | Linux Foundation | Open Source Open Source Summit North America · Jun 23-25 · Denver REGISTER"},"02b7d10894b573eba12fa2063baa0778":{"url":"https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/06/android-16-new-features/","title":"Android 16 Introduces Wide-Ranging Features and Changes - InfoQ","description":"Google has released Android 16, now available for supported Pixel devices.

This presentation delves into the complex world of screen readers, exploring how these essential tools empower visually impaired individuals to effectively interact with computers. We will underscore the continued importance of the keyboard as the most effective input device for visually impaired users, even in the modern digital environment. As we transition from legacy systems to modern platforms like Wayland and GTK 4, significant challenges arise in handling input devices. Our discussion will cover the current state of screen reader integration with these platforms, the obstacles presented by deprecated APIs, particularly in GTK 4, and the interactions involved in the shift to Wayland. This talk will also introduce a new approach that, when embraced by all stakeholders, promises to resolve these challenges effectively. Join us as we explore the path toward a more inclusive digital world, where technology truly empowers all users, regardless of their abilities.","content_snippet":"Bridging Accessibility Barriers: Enhancing Screen Reader Functionality in Modern Gnome :: Flock to F"},"0e57487b45e893178dbf70d894e80850":{"url":"https://learn.wordpress.org/lesson/website-optimization/","title":"Website optimization | Learn WordPress","description":"Learn which elements impact performance, and how to test and optimize your site’s speed.","content_snippet":"Website optimization | Learn WordPress HomeCoursesIntermediate WordPress UserWebsite optimization Ex"},"0e5a8a1ea9d671a90560403ec4e41948":{"url":"https://paulgraham.com/maybe.html","title":"Can You Buy a Silicon Valley?

Third, set boundaries, even if it makes others unhappy.

Incivility on the job is getting worse, and each day it costs companies billions in lost productivity and absenteeism. To navigate the discord, today’s business leaders need to develop conflict intelligence, writes Coleman, a Columbia professor and expert on conflict resolution. Like emotional intelligence, conflict intelligence involves empathy, self-regulation, and social awareness, but it also includes situational awareness and understanding the social dynamics and systemic forces that influence disputes. Drawing examples from the work of peacemakers, diplomats, and business executives, Coleman highlights seven strategies that conflict-intelligent leaders use to manage volatile situations: laying the groundwork for better communication and trust, fostering collaborative relationships through meaningful joint ventures, balancing firmness with creative solutions, using adaptive approaches, leveraging the broader context, investing in the long term, and being opportunistic. Leaders who use these tactics do more than tamp down disagreements, Coleman notes. They also create company cultures where employees feel more safe, satisfied, and creative and can handle uncertainty and stress better.","content_snippet":"The Conflict-Intelligent LeaderSKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoLeadershipThe Conflict-Int"},"148a99326bfc61a1d5080054f6955def":{"url":"https://www.digitalocean.com/legal","title":"Legal | DigitalOcean","description":"Helping millions of developers easily build, test, manage, and scale applications of any size - faster than ever before.","content_snippet":"Legal | DigitalOceanLegalWe believe in being responsible data stewards.Terms of Service AgreementLea"},"14a252c2e7c01e0cf65f5cd996c3789a":{"url":"https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/02/02/day-51--made-a-couple-of-puzzles/","title":"Day 51: Fixed my logging and made a couple of puzzles","description":"Day 51: Fixed my logging and made a couple of puzzles","content_snippet":"Day 51: Fixed my logging and made a couple of puzzles Skip to main content Here are a couple of thin"},"14aa191f90d6be6efccfa5ab69b73f92":{"url":"https://click.fourhourmail.com/68uv509pqdh8h525m9ms0tpx5wkkkh9h6rd/6qheh8hl6nd46puo/aHR0cHM6Ly9kcmlua2FnMS5jb20vcGFydG5lci90aW0vY3RyP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1UaW1GZXJyaXNzNUJ1bGxldEZyaWRheV9kMzVjdF9fYTEwMzVfX28yMiZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1TZWxmLUltcHJvdmVtZW50X19hMTAzNV9fbzIyJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09cGFydG5lcnNoaXBzJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fdGVybT12YXJpYWJsZV9fYTEwMzVfX28yMg==","title":"AG1® | Tim Ferriss","description":"","content_snippet":"AG1® | Tim FerrissGet started with your AG1 Welcome Kit**Get started with your AG1 Welcome Kit**Get "},"14b550af3aad476226c40bce36ec67a5":{"url":"https://valkey.io/","title":"Valkey","description":"","content_snippet":"Valkey Valkey 8.1 is generally available!

But without the right leadership, collaboration can go astray. Employees who try to collaborate on everything may wind up stuck in endless meetings, struggling to reach agreement. On the other side of the coin, executives who came of age during the heyday of “command and control” management can have trouble adjusting their style to fit the new realities. In their research on top-performing CEOs, Insead professors Ibarra and Hansen have examined what it takes to be a collaborative leader. They’ve found that it requires connecting people and ideas outside an organization to those inside it, leveraging diverse talent, modeling collaborative behavior at the top, and showing a strong hand to keep teams from getting mired in debate. In this article, they describe tactics that executives from Akamai, GE, Reckitt Benckiser, and other firms use in those four areas and how they foster high-performance collaborative cultures in their organizations.","content_snippet":"Are You a Collaborative Leader?SKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoLeadershipAre You a Collab"},"154991039626b3a8de1ceef7ee3b73b9":{"url":"https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/","title":"Cloudflare customer case studies provide cyber security testimonials and customer use cases for a suite of website security and performance products. | Cloudflare","description":"Cloudflare customer case studies provide cyber security testimonials and customer use cases for a suite of website security and performance products.","content_snippet":"Cloudflare customer case studies provide cyber security testimonials and customer use cases for a su"},"15528426cd52ee9733cbcfb0f2d0ba05":{"url":"https://www.economist.com/subscriber-events/donald-trumps-return-what-to-expect-hub","title":"Donald Trump&#x27;s return: what to expect","description":"Join us a day after the inauguration for a discussion on what Donald Trump’s second administration means for America and the world.

Saloi","description":"Last year I did a bunch of Skillshare courses, read a few books, and watched a lot of Youtube content on Photography. You can find my notes below: Position of the subject is important, but equally important is the position of the photgrapher. Perspective: low angle, high angle, lateral movement, 1st POV. Try all angles. Vantage points: point of focus through lateral lines, geometric and organic. Shoot through something. Rule of thirds. Use background as 2nd subject. Use dead space. Show ground to give perception of depth. Light: into light, with light, sideways. Utilise the light. Golden hour is best. Always think framing. Use the environment. Fill the frame. Everything in the frame should be part of a story you are telling. Take multiple shots. Pay attention to the borders of your frame. Keep focus on the subject. Ask what you want your image to say before you decide how to say it. Think what everybody does. Do the opposite for an unique perspective. Shoot landscape mode more. You can always turn it into portrait if needed. Storytelling: hero vs what lies ahead, hero vs the world, I am too cool, follow me. Combination: vantage point + high angle.","content_snippet":"Notes on photography | Manas J.

As the Infrastructure team started preparing for the upcoming seasonal traffic in the late summer of 2014, we were confident that we could cope, and determined resiliency to be the top priority. A resilient system is one that functions with one or more components being unavailable or unacceptably slow. Applications quickly become intertwined with their external services if not carefully monitored, leading to minor dependencies becoming single points of failure. For example, the only part of Shopify that relies on the session store is user sign-in - if the session store is unavailable, customers can still purchase products as guests. Any other behaviour would be an unfortunate coupling of components. This post is an overview of the tools and techniques we used to make Shopify more resilient in preparation for the holiday season.","content_snippet":"Building and Testing Resilient Ruby on Rails Applications - ShopifySkip to Contentblog|Developer Too"},"191eb3b7096bc805cb16915ef2b76d7b":{"url":"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/page/1","title":"Scott Hanselman - Scott Hanselman's Blog","description":"Scott Hanselman is blogging about open source, .NET, and the cloud.","content_snippet":"Scott Hanselman - Scott Hanselman's Blog Scott Hanselman browse by category or date Use your own use"},"19211737909a0a20398e6e31ee8e02e5":{"url":"https://duckduckgo.com/l/?uddg=https%3A%2F%2Fproductschool.com%2Fblog%2Fanalytics%2F15%2Dblogs%2Dproduct%2Dmanagers%2Ddesign%2Ddata%2Dbusiness&rut=2ec05b7102b2b8ac9b53a416c5a5bdd58c3a6e6a1b6bf1eaccb06a1220585c83","title":"","description":"","content_snippet":""},"19227060851f55b720889b466f4b1877":{"url":"https://martinfowler.com/tags/privacy.html","title":"privacy","description":"","content_snippet":"privacy tagged by: privacy Privacy Protects Bothersome People We need to support privacy, not for th"},"193746cb4b35f55ae804a61de997cd63":{"url":"https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/tag/kde-neon","title":"KDE neon Archives - OMG!

Your decisions may now affect dozens (or hundreds) of employees. Your results depend on how well other experienced professionals do their jobs, not on what you can personally make happen. Stepping into these shifts doesn’t happen overnight and it can feel nerve-wracking for a while. This article outlines three key shifts you need to make: 1) Going from expert to coach, 2) Moving from execution to driving impact through others, 3) Evolving from oversight to scalable systems. Leading leaders isn’t “more of the same” just with bigger teams and budgets. In reality, you have to fundamentally shift how you think about your role, how you spend your time, and how you measure success.","content_snippet":"Navigating the Jump from Manager to ExecutiveSKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoLeadership t"},"194c1199f4b452b4eb7a623577999b4e":{"url":"https://stratechery.com/2025/youtube-tv-wiz-and-why-monopolies-buy-innovation/","title":"YouTube TV, Wiz, and Why Monopolies Buy Innovation &#8211; Stratechery by Ben Thompson","description":"","content_snippet":"YouTube TV, Wiz, and Why Monopolies Buy Innovation – Stratechery by Ben Thompson YouTube TV, Wiz, an"},"194e5181174f1061e9d0162dc80e1542":{"url":"https://www.theverge.com/policy/691520/ftc-omnicom-interpublic-group-merger-advertiser-boycott-political-ideology","title":"Trump’s FTC agrees to Omnicom merger — with a gift to X | The Verge","description":"In a proposed consent order to approve Omnicom’s $13.5 billion merger with Interpublic Group, the Federal Trade Commission seeks to bar ad spend coordination based on ideology.","content_snippet":"Trump’s FTC agrees to Omnicom merger — with a gift to X | The VergeSkip to main contentThe homepageT"},"19561ad293952be80a0eee9be7bd9264":{"url":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/maxs-longer-commercial-breaks-bring-ad-load-to-6-minutes-per-hour/","title":"Longer commercial breaks lower the value of ad&#x2d;based streaming subscriptions &#x2d; Ars Technica","description":"WBD also started showing ads during HBO programming.","content_snippet":"Longer commercial breaks lower the value of ad-based streaming subscriptions - Ars Technica Skip to "},"1959d28dbd79e0c8bc791139c3a4c27d":{"url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/10/23594756/twitter-ads-toxic-content-holocaust-deniers-media-matters-report-study","title":"Twitter is running ads next to tweets from Holocaust deniers | The Verge","description":"A report from Media Matters for America found that ads for companies including The Wall Street Journal and Nokia were appearing next to content from Holocaust deniers.","content_snippet":"Twitter is running ads next to tweets from Holocaust deniers | The VergeSkip to main contentThe home"},"195b7dd97ad2b667bd07476eeab50e5f":{"url":"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/us-govt-pushing-tsmc-and-intel-to-create-joint-venture-in-the-us-report","title":"US gov't pushing TSMC and Intel to create joint venture in the US: Report | Tom's Hardware","description":"TSMC has made no official announcements about expanding in the U.S. at the board meetings this week, but the rumor mill points to quicker expansion in Arizona and a joint venture with Intel.","content_snippet":"US gov't pushing TSMC and Intel to create joint venture in the US: Report | Tom's Hardware Skip to m"},"195e9f61fb4c339a92dc0dde26165182":{"url":"https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research/guide-to-enterprise-open-source?hsLang=en","title":"A Guide to Enterprise Open Source: Developing and Executing Open Source Software Strategy","description":"A Guide to Enterprise Open Source","content_snippet":"A Guide to Enterprise Open Source: Developing and Executing Open Source Software Strategy Open Sourc"},"1968185f7a9c3f6e3ef55200b13fff8b":{"url":"https://www.fosslife.org/","title":"| FOSSlife","description":"","content_snippet":"| FOSSlife Home News Features Careers Community Life in Tech Skills Resources About us Newsletter Se"},"196ad831ed4f9a2b4f217c6a0458f026":{"url":"https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-chrome-137?hl=en","title":"New in Chrome 137 &nbsp;|&nbsp; Blog &nbsp;|&nbsp; Chrome for Developers","description":"CSS reading-flow and reading-order, the if() function, JavaScript Promise Integration with WebAssembly and plenty more.","content_snippet":"New in Chrome 137 | Blog | Chrome for Developers Skip to main content / English Deutsch Español – Am"},"196dcb4216996aaf53318553c737d97e":{"url":"https://www.wired.com/subscribe/","title":"WIRED - The Latest in Technology, Science, Culture and Business | WIRED","description":"Unlock a world of benefits, only for WIRED subscribers.| Plus, access WIRED&#x27;s next Livestream Q&amp;A | Get 1 year for &lt;del&gt;$30&lt;/del&gt; $12","content_snippet":"WIRED - The Latest in Technology, Science, Culture and Business | WIREDUnlock a world of benefits, o"},"1973a3362d8c0f13cfa6efa348bfb37b":{"url":"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/139.0/releasenotes/","title":"Firefox 139.0, See All New Features, Updates and Fixes","description":"","content_snippet":"Firefox 139.0, See All New Features, Updates and Fixes Help us improve your Mozilla experience In ad"},"1983681530fcbe7b29de138d253c334b":{"url":"https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/renesas-stmicroelectronics-and-ac6-join-the-zephyr-project-as-it-launches-the-3.6-release","title":"Renesas, STMicroelectronics and Ac6 join the Zephyr Project as it Launches the 3.6 Release","description":"The Zephyr® Project announced that Renesas Electronics Corporation, STMicroelectronics and Ac6 have joined as Silver members.

By supporting the kernel development community -- including employing Linus Torvalds himself -- and fostering collaboration on a truly massive scale, The Linux Foundation unites thousands of curious minds in the free and open exchange of ideas. We are also dedicated to expanding the collaborative DNA of Linux to other industries and markets. Companies, open source projects and individual developers can work with our Linux Foundation Collaborative Projects to make collaborative development the de facto way of solving the world’s hardest problems. The Linux Foundation is pleased to partner with edX to deliver our courses to anyone, anywhere in the world, at any time.

Saloi","description":"Thoughts on lifestyle inflation: It is real. There is no shame in acknowledging it. At one point in my life I thought 1CR was enough. At 6% FD rate I would get 50K per month. My rent was 12/13K at that time. I thought: How can I spend more than 50,000 a month? It was impossible to do. I had one room in a 2 BHK flat. I didn’t eat out that much. I hadn’t really got into the Apple ecosystem. And yes, I did not understand the concept of inflation at all. I could have easily afforded a much better house. But I always preferred to live well below my means. And maintain a lifestyle that was recession-proof. My rent is now ~47K a month. That is 3/4 of what it was 5 years ago. Rent in Bangalore has also gone up significantly. But it is still a lot less than what most of my friends are paying as rent in Bangalore. I also live in Murugeshpalya. I do not live in the Defence Colony in Indiranagar. Can I afford to pay more? Sure. There’s no need to do that. I have always been happy to live a life of low (er) status. At least in comparison to my peers/friends. I do not own a house. I don’t have a car of my own. I can probably afford to have both of them. Don’t want to. Tech bro salaries are a good way to boost your savings. But if you inflate your lifestyle too much and increase your recurring expenses too much, you become a slave to that high-paying job. I am happy to spend more on one-off expenses: holidays, purchases of things that give me short-term pleasure, but I am also happy to downgrade if I ever have to live on a lower budget. I am happy to spend more on a hotel room from time to time, while I am perfectly happy to stay in a cheap hostel if I have to. I get the same amount of pleasure from both. And I don’t even have an Instagram account. So who knows where I’ve been on my holiday? My only worry: getting into debt, maybe finally getting sucked into buying a flat in Bengaluru, and EMI tying me to a high paying job. Recurring expenses worry me. And that I will not have the ability to get rid of them. One-off fixed expenses are fine. When it comes to reducing my cost of living, I can go back to my wired One Plus headphones and ditch my AirPods. Do experiences matter more than things? Who knows. I had a great time in Bali when I was there in February. Three years from now, I probably won’t even remember it. But it was a lot of fun while I was there. I use my PS5 weekly. And I listen to podcasts on my AirPods on a daily basis. I spent a lot on my squat rack, but also bought used weights from Kengeri. I went there by taking the metro. I picked up all the weights. Came back in the same Porter truck that I used to load my weights in. But I also gamble a lot. I was down 3.2L this year, before I recovered all of it. Now I am decently up. I’m not consistent when it comes to how I like to spend. I do what I like. So should you. You decide. Don’t change everything about the way you live your life based on what you read on Twitter. Most people there are as confused as you or I. They just have a lot of strong opinions and shout a lot. Find what makes you happy. Spend on those things. It is your money. But yes, try saving some. The markets are very unpredictable. To ride out downturns, you should have a decent nest egg.","content_snippet":"Lifestyle inflation | Manas J. Saloi Thoughts on lifestyle inflation: It is real.

In the sensory cortex, perceptual learning drives neural plasticity1&#8211;13, but it is not known whether this is due to supervised or unsupervised learning. Here we recorded populations of up to 90,000 neurons simultaneously from the primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas (HVAs) while mice learned multiple tasks, as well as during unrewarded exposure to the same stimuli. Similar to previous studies, we found that neural changes in task mice were correlated with their behavioural learning. However, the neural changes were mostly replicated in mice with unrewarded exposure, suggesting that the changes were in fact due to unsupervised learning. The neural plasticity was highest in the medial HVAs and obeyed visual, rather than spatial, learning rules. In task mice only, we found a ramping reward-prediction signal in anterior HVAs, potentially involved in supervised learning. Our neural results predict that unsupervised learning may accelerate subsequent task learning, a prediction that we validated with behavioural experiments.

Saloi","description":"Run my website: Whenever I go off Twitter, my website suffers. I find writing threads the easiest way to dump my thoughts on a topic. Then writing bogposts just becomes editing those threads and posting them here. No Twitter = No blogposts. I want to continue writing. It is therapautic. And helps me crystalise my thoughts. I am too lazy to sit and write. Twitter is where the first draft of my posts happen. Ego: I somehow think that a single tweet I write might help someone take a big life or career decision. A random book recommendation from me might become someone’s favourite book. Yes, I am that vain. Confirmation bias: People DM’ing me thanking me for my tweets makes me think I matter. Dopamine: I don’t post on any other social media. Sharing shitposts and seeing people like them gives me that sweet sweet dopamine rush. Career growth: I complained about startup titles recently and called most leaders of the startup ecosystem winners of the startup lottery. By night I had a CEO reach out to me with a job offer. I will still say that Twitter should remain far down the priorities one should have if they want to have a successful tech career, but it does help at some level. I would be a hypocrite if I said otherwise. Friendships: I have made a few really good friends from Twitter. I hate networking, nor do I go out much. I would have far fewer people in my life without Twitter. Audience for my private sessions: I occasionally do sessions based on some theory I have on life or careeer. To get people I generally post a tweet. I get dozens of people DMing and signing up inside 10 mins. Without my Twitter, I would have to search for interested people. That would be painful. I love giving gyaan, but not that much that I will go out of my way to seek out people. Dealflow: A lot of founders who reach out to me for advice discover me from Twitter. If I ever take angel investing seriously, I won’t need to build a network. My twitter will be enough. Access and status: Senior leaders from my company reach out from time to time to discuss something I posted. It feels good. There is no chance of us working together on a day to day basis, but thanks to my twitter account, we get a reason to catchup. Twitter is good that way. There are a lot of positves, but the downside is me losing my job because of some shitpost that I posted in 5 mins without thinking too much. This might come true any day. Cheap therapy: This is probably the biggest reason. Dumping whatever thoughts I have on Twitter is therapautic. I delete so many tweet threads inside like 10 minutes. Once I tweet out something, I stop thinking about it, and move on to other things. I have been writing online for more than 10 years. At this point I probably write as much for myself as others. Complaining platform: I can complain about products/companies if I am unhappy. Customer service reacts immediately here. Also, I don’t have Facebook. So where else will I complain?","content_snippet":"Why I tweet | Manas J. Saloi Run my website: Whenever I go off Twitter, my website suffers.

Third, set boundaries, even if it makes others unhappy. Finally, define times where you’ll be really “on”—and really “off.”","content_snippet":"Is Your Flexible Schedule Burning You Out?SKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoFlex timeIs You"},"2a98c56d42ec22219bc1af6fd0733b00":{"url":"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-ai-recruiting-mark-zuckerberg-5c231f75","title":"wsj.com","description":"","content_snippet":"wsj.comPlease enable JS and disable any ad blocker..."},"2aa99e9f3267ca6f3e439c502c094f55":{"url":"https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/","title":"Advanced Administration Handbook | Developer.WordPress.org","description":"Welcome to the WordPress Advanced Administration Handbook!

Saloi","description":"I use Loop Habit Tracker to form new habits. There are 3 kinds of habits I track: the most important ones (marked in red) behavior at work (marked in green) health related (marked in blue) A few examples: Red: Don’t rant on Twitter (rarely successful in this), Listen more, No vertical relationships(read Courage to be Diskliked to understand this more) Green: Be kind, Don’t send a Slack DM in anger Blue: Sit in the sun, Meditate, Take Vitamin C I am tracking some 20 habits at this point. Every night before I sleep I mark each habit with Yes or No. For health habits, I don’t want to think and just act like an NPC. Gobble up all my Vitamins, meditate using Waking Up, and stretch before I start my day. Other habits are where I want to be more intentional. Whenever I fail, I don’t wait for the night to update the app, I just mark them as failed for the day. One example being, sending a text in anger. One message sent in anger means I fail the habit for the day. When I fail to maintain any of the major habits I am tracking, I tell my wife about it. Then I start transferring 500/1000 on UPI to her everytime I fail. Got pissed at someone for not taking ownership? Raised my voice? Have to transfer 500 INR after the zoom call ends. Now you might ask the right question: How is transfering money to my wife a loss to me? The money stays in the family. I disagree. The very act of sending the 500/1000 bucks to my wife makes me think about what I did. My phone homepage is also a screenshot of my Phonepe page so that I remember. When I do this exercise at night, I go throughout the day in my head. This helps me live my life more intentionally and not default into NPC mode like most people. I am writing this post so that I can send this to people I mentor. I have shared a few of these tips in silos, but this captures most of what I do. When I joined my current company, I promised myself that I will take ownership of my career. I marked around 5 habits that was holding me back in my career and promised to get better on all of them. Big thanks to my manager for identifying them and giving proactive feedback during our 1:1s. He also helped me with my gap analysis. One of the habits I track is called “Act like L+1”. L being my current level, L+1 the next. When I was a Product Lead (L4), I was tracking whether I was acting like a Manager (L5) or not. When I was a Manager I tracked whether I acted like a GPM or not. Now I track my day with the lens of a Director at Gojek. In 3 years I have gone from new joinee -&gt; Product Lead -&gt; Manager, Product Management -&gt; GPM, with a promotion almost every year. (This point is not to brag, but to prove that this approach works.) Now you can get there by luck too. Join the right company at the right time, let the machinery do the work, and you can just be pulled up over time. The other options are being super political or working 80 hour weeks. I like shipping vs being political and I am somewhat lazy. Relying on just luck is sub optimal and I wanted something that can be replicated by people I mentor. I get an alert from my Tick Tack app everyday that reminds me to update my Loop Habits app before I sleep. Public accountability helps. This is the reason I used to share my personal OKRs publicly till last year.","content_snippet":"Forming habits | Manas J. Saloi I use Loop Habit Tracker to form new habits.

These results exposed limitations in design methodology and suggested critical gaps in our understanding of the fundamentals of biocatalysis10,11. We present a fully computational workflow for designing efficient enzymes in TIM-barrel folds using backbone fragments from natural proteins and without requiring optimization by mutant-library screening. Three Kemp eliminase designs exhibit efficiencies greater than 2,000&#8201;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. The most efficient shows more than 140 mutations from any natural protein, including a novel active site. It exhibits high stability (greater than 85&#8201;&#176;C) and remarkable catalytic efficiency (12,700&#8201;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) and rate (2.8&#8201;s&#8722;1), surpassing previous computational designs by two orders of magnitude1&#8211;5. Furthermore, designing a residue considered essential in all previous Kemp eliminase designs increases efficiency to more than 105&#8201;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and rate to 30&#8201;s&#8722;1, achieving catalytic parameters comparable to natural enzymes and challenging fundamental biocatalytic assumptions. By overcoming limitations in design methodology11, our strategy enables programming stable, high-efficiency, new-to-nature enzymes through a minimal experimental effort. We present a computational approach to the design of high-efficiency enzymes with catalytic parameters comparable to natural enzymes, enabling programming of stable, high-efficiency, new-to-nature Kemp elimination enzymes through minimal experimental effort.","content_snippet":"Complete computational design of high-efficiency Kemp elimination enzymes | Nature Skip to main cont"},"35586f433cfa21abbfde764ac99b5bb8":{"url":"https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/openssf-to-support-darpa-on-new-ai-cyber-challenge-aixcc","title":"OpenSSF to Support DARPA on New AI Cyber Challenge (AIxCC)","description":"The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) announced today at Black Hat 2023 its collaboration with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) on the AI Cyber Challenge (AIxCC) – a two-year competition aimed at driving innovation at the nexus of AI and cybersecurity to create a new generation of cybersecurity tools.","content_snippet":"OpenSSF to Support DARPA on New AI Cyber Challenge (AIxCC) Open Source Summit North America · Jun 23"},"35587b48184c871d3e6bcae610810651":{"url":"https://paulgraham.com/island.html","title":"The Island Test","description":"","content_snippet":"The Island Test July 2006I've discovered a handy test for figuring out what you're addicted to.

Many firms, however, don’t have the option to bring employees back on-site, for a variety of reasons: They no longer have sufficient office space to house everyone, their employees are now dispersed geographically, or they fear a rebellion by hard-to-replace talent. But few leaders in those situations have faced this reality: You can’t effectively manage remote and hybrid workers using the same methods you did when employees were still all together in the office. Re-creating the cooperation and collaboration that happens in the office in a virtual context requires new rules and procedures for how people are managed day-to-day—as well as mandates that reel in some current practices.","content_snippet":"Hybrid Still Isn’t WorkingSKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoHybrid workHybrid Still Isn’t W"},"3d32c5a159aeae3212f9699d0c14002c":{"url":"https://martinfowler.com/tags/ruby.html","title":"ruby","description":"","content_snippet":"ruby tagged by: ruby Is TDD Dead?

Many firms, however, don’t have the option to bring employees back on-site, for a variety of reasons: They no longer have sufficient office space to house everyone, their employees are now dispersed geographically, or they fear a rebellion by hard-to-replace talent. But few leaders in those situations have faced this reality: You can’t effectively manage remote and hybrid workers using the same methods you did when employees were still all together in the office. Re-creating the cooperation and collaboration that happens in the office in a virtual context requires new rules and procedures for how people are managed day-to-day—as well as mandates that reel in some current practices.","content_snippet":"Hybrid Still Isn’t WorkingSKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoHybrid workHybrid Still Isn’t W"},"4233fa42bc54215406beade2687f6810":{"url":"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/vpc","title":"DigitalOcean VPC Hosting | Get Started in Seconds","description":"Easily secure your cloud resources within private, isolated virtual private cloud networks with DigitalOcean.","content_snippet":"DigitalOcean VPC Hosting | Get Started in SecondsVirtual Private CloudEasily secure your cloud resou"},"4234453c68d5f737b877708699af5497":{"url":"https://tim.blog/2012/07/12/how-to-lose-100-pounds/","title":"How to Lose 100 Pounds on The Slow-Carb Diet - Real Pics and Stories - The Blog of Author Tim Ferriss","description":"Patrick lost more than 100 pounds on The Slow-Carb Diet.

It is important not just to hype up your product before your possible $3B fundraise, but it is also important to counter-position versus the biggest vibe coding tool currently valued at $2B, and thereby using this competitor as an anchor for pricing their next upcoming round. If you saw Friday email’s recent video and how they were subtly counter-positioning versus Superhuman, you will understand the marketing efforts of these AI companies better. Working in Southeast Asia and seeing how Chinese founders operate has made me appreciate The Art of War a great deal, and it is lovely to see various tactics being deployed on our timeline.","content_snippet":"Windsurf marketing | Manas J.

Saloi","description":"I remember a discussion with Nikhil(one of the best thinkers in the fintech space, btw, and og UPI crew) about utility bill payments, and he pointed out how it has evolved. Bill payments 1.0: You would get a physical electricity bill. You would then go to the office of the electricity company to pay it.

You have to create a flow that requires the least number of steps for the customer to buy your product. The second is a habit-forming product with a freemium business model. You have to understand the user’s motivation. You want them to set reminders to drink their protein shake in the morning. Your product is very similar to any meditation app, any strength training app. Obviously there will be more steps in the onboarding process. You want high intent users who will convert to premium users.

While extensive structural studies have been conducted on recombinant AMPARs and native calcium impermeable (CI)-AMPARs alongside their auxiliary proteins2-5, the molecular architecture of native calcium permeable (CP)-AMPARs has remained undefined. To elucidate the subunit composition, physiological architecture, and gating mechanisms of CP-AMPARs, here we present the first visualization of these receptors, immunoaffinity purified from rat cerebella, and resolve their structures using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Our results indicate that the predominant assembly consists of GluA1 and GluA4 subunits, with the GluA4 subunit occupying the B and D positions, while auxiliary subunits, including TARPs, are located at the B&#8242;/D&#8242; positions and CNIHs or TARPs at the A&#8242;/C&#8242; positions. Furthermore, we resolved the structure of the Noelin 1-GluA1/A4 complex, wherein Noelin 1 (Noe 1) specifically binds to the GluA4 subunit at the B and D positions. Notably, Noe 1 stabilizes the amino-terminal domain (ATD) layer without affecting receptor gating properties. Noe 1 contributes to AMPAR function by forming dimeric-AMPAR assemblies that likely engage in extracellular networks, clustering receptors within synaptic environments and modulating receptor responsiveness to synaptic inputs.","content_snippet":"Gating and noelin clustering of native Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors | Nature Skip to main content T"},"558139185004b2804f47e9593e2138a3":{"url":"https://www.theverge.com/news/691287/xbox-home-ui-pin-favorite-games-apps-rolling-out","title":"Microsoft’s Xbox UI update lets you pin games and customize your homescreen | The Verge","description":"Microsoft is allowing Xbox owners to pin their favorite games or apps to the homescreen.

Yet it’s the missing piece for many ambitious individuals, the authors found after examining data on how nearly 2,000 professionals spend their days. Jam-packed schedules are a factor, their research showed, because people experience more joy during their limited free time than while working or doing household chores. Interestingly, however, what people did with their extra time was more important than how many hours of it they had. The authors uncovered five strategies that will help you get more out of your free time: (1) Engage with others. Sharing experiences amplifies joy. (2) Avoid passive pursuits. The more time you spend on active ones, the more satisfied you’ll be with your life. (3) Follow your passions. Doing what you find personally rewarding delivers significantly more benefits than doing things that typically are considered “good for you.” (4) Diversify your activities. Variety—not depth—boosts happiness. (5) Protect your free time. Don’t let work encroach on it; if you use it wisely, your well-being and job engagement will both increase, and you’ll actually get more value out of your work.","content_snippet":"How the Busiest People Find JoySKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoManaging yourselfHow the B"},"55d80d1f64872dc76469267c1125f774":{"url":"https://tim.blog/2025/04/17/rich-barton/?share=reddit","title":"Reddit - The heart of the internet","description":"","content_snippet":"Reddit - The heart of the internet Skip to main content..."},"55de59938e0b0db60c9c65b9a73194a4":{"url":"https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=https://www.hanselman.com/blog/using-wsl-and-lets-encrypt-to-create-azure-app-service-ssl-wildcard-certificates","title":"Bluesky","description":"","content_snippet":"Bluesky JavaScript Required This is a heavily interactive web application, and JavaScript is require"},"55e0c84c0cb920c3259242491b7718ad":{"url":"https://engineering.fb.com/category/production-engineering/","title":"Production Engineering Archives - Engineering at Meta","description":"","content_snippet":"Production Engineering Archives - Engineering at Meta Skip to content Articles Videos Publications T"},"55e364dab012ce8721d02731da50054a":{"url":"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/rules/f/font-feature-values/","title":"@font-feature-values | CSS-Tricks","description":"The @font-feature-values at-rule gives a human-readable name to the font&#039;s settings seen in font-feature-settings, such as style sets, ornaments, and swashes.","content_snippet":"@font-feature-values | CSS-Tricks Get affordable and hassle-free WordPress hosting plans with Cloudw"},"55ec4172207170f1cb0040c352e624d8":{"url":"https://manassaloi.com/2022/06/02/daily-habits-tracking.html","title":"Habits I am tracking daily | Manas J.

To help employees rise to this challenge, the authors argue, employers need to step up, just as the majority have done for childcare, by providing more support in the form of new and expanded business policies, programs, and benefits. The business case for doing so is straightforward: Supporting elder caregivers improves productivity, retention, recruitment, and diversity. In this article the authors discuss who the providers of eldercare are, what demands they face, and what kinds of support they need most. The authors also provide examples of organizations that are leading the way in offering eldercare support to their employees. They conclude by providing some practical guidance to leaders who want their organizations to meet the challenges and opportunities of this demographic shift.","content_snippet":"Your Company Needs an Eldercare PolicySKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoWork-life balanceYo"},"611b90dcc3604be82c41c5906e8d9c94":{"url":"https://blog.codinghorror.com/about-me/","title":"About Me","description":"","content_snippet":"About Me I’m Jeff Atwood.

Yet it’s the missing piece for many ambitious individuals, the authors found after examining data on how nearly 2,000 professionals spend their days. Jam-packed schedules are a factor, their research showed, because people experience more joy during their limited free time than while working or doing household chores. Interestingly, however, what people did with their extra time was more important than how many hours of it they had. The authors uncovered five strategies that will help you get more out of your free time: (1) Engage with others. Sharing experiences amplifies joy. (2) Avoid passive pursuits. The more time you spend on active ones, the more satisfied you’ll be with your life. (3) Follow your passions. Doing what you find personally rewarding delivers significantly more benefits than doing things that typically are considered “good for you.” (4) Diversify your activities. Variety—not depth—boosts happiness. (5) Protect your free time. Don’t let work encroach on it; if you use it wisely, your well-being and job engagement will both increase, and you’ll actually get more value out of your work.","content_snippet":"How the Busiest People Find JoySKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoManaging yourselfHow the B"},"62671ed326962dcf65a5013ce91e202d":{"url":"https://wordpress.org/news/category/store/","title":"Store &#8211; WordPress News","description":"","content_snippet":"Store – WordPress News WordPress.org News Store Celebrate the WordPress 15th Anniversary on May 27 A"},"6271e77b0d59dd38a91602ca4ad0a34b":{"url":"https://www.economist.com/business/2025/06/18/ai-is-turning-the-ad-business-upside-down","title":"AI is turning the ad business upside down","description":"At the industry’s annual event in Cannes, executives are feeling the heat | Business","content_snippet":"AI is turning the ad business upside downMy EconomistUnlimited digital access to all reporting, podc"},"627d1426308a794d619b5d0078d5b018":{"url":"https://andymatuschak.org/books","title":"Why books donÊ¼t work | Andy Matuschak","description":"","content_snippet":"Why books donÊ¼t work | Andy MatuschakAndyMatuschakAndy MatuschakEmailTwitterI'm an applied research"},"6294c5688e8ad5d1009459b490b6acd0":{"url":"https://seths.blog/free-content/","title":"Free content | Seth&#039;s Blog","description":"Seth Godin&#039;s Blog on marketing, tribes and respect","content_snippet":"Free content | Seth's Blog You have unread updates 0 Search Search for: Or try my new AI-powered sea"},"62982be3f1009ccd09fd3dde56c19fe1":{"url":"https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html","title":"How Tesla Will Change The World &#8212; Wait But Why","description":"The story of how change really happens.","content_snippet":"How Tesla Will Change The World — Wait But Why This is Part 2 of a four-part series on Elon Musk’s c"},"629883af3a4fffcc750c296cae20e63b":{"url":"https://www.givedirectly.org/united-states/","title":"Cash Aid in the U.S. | GiveDirectly","description":"Send money directly to low&#x2d;income families in the U.S. Since 2017, GiveDirectly has delivered unconditional cash transfers to 220,000+ households across the country.","content_snippet":"Cash Aid in the U.S. | GiveDirectly Skip to content GiveDirectly in the U.S. Send money directly to "},"629adf4627060b9b9f2f0609e166b3b3":{"url":"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/category/open-source","title":"Category - Scott Hanselman - Scott Hanselman's Blog","description":"Category - Scott Hanselman is blogging about open source, .NET, and the cloud.","content_snippet":"Category - Scott Hanselman - Scott Hanselman's Blog Scott Hanselman browse by category or date Open "},"62a17839adb226901a6df8b185100580":{"url":"https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/03/10/help/","title":"Hacker School&#39;s Secret Strategy for Being Super Productive (or: Help.)","description":"Hacker School&#39;s Secret Strategy for Being Super Productive (or: Help.)","content_snippet":"Hacker School's Secret Strategy for Being Super Productive (or: Help.)

Here, we use a dispatch optimization model to assess potential increases in hourly costs associated with such climate-intensified gaps under fixed, high penetrations of wind and solar generation. We further explore various strategies to enhance system resilience in the face of future climate change. We find that extreme periods&#8212;defined as hours in the upper decile of hourly costs (i.e., the most-costly 10% of hours)&#8212;are likely to become more costly in the future in most countries, mainly due to the increased need for investments in flexible energy capacity. For example, under the SSP126 scenario, 47 countries that together account for approximately 43.5% of global future electricity generation are projected to experience more than a 5% increase in average hourly costs during extreme periods, with the largest reaching up to 23.7%. Promisingly, the risk of rising costs could be substantially mitigated through tailored, country-specific strategies involving the coordinated implementation of multiple measures to address supply-demand imbalances and enhance system flexibility. Our findings provide critical insights for building future climate-resilient power systems while reducing system costs.","content_snippet":"Strategies for climate-resilient global wind and solar power systems | Nature Skip to main content T"},"65a2f424e70bd04d0ea268181c0eadd3":{"url":"https://changelog.com/podcast/412","title":"Estimating systems with napkin math featuring Simon Eskildsen (Changelog Interviews #412)","description":"We&#39;re joined by Simon Eskildsen, Principal Engineer at Shopify, talking about how he uses a concept called napkin math where you use first-principle thinking to estimate systems without writing any code.

They’re becoming digital teammates—an emerging category of talent. To get the most out of these new teammates, leaders in HR and procurement will need to start developing an operational playbook for integrating them into hybrid teams and a workforce strategy. That strategy will require that companies either develop a talent-acquisition function of their own that allows them to integrate AI agents into their workforce, or partner with firms that now offer both human and AI staffing solutions. To succeed in this new environment, however, organizations must actively shape how AI is integrated into their labor strategy rather than waiting for the market to evolve around it. In this article, the authors survey this rapidly evolving terrain and recommend seven critical actions that companies should take to successfully adapt.","content_snippet":"Agentic AI Is Already Changing the WorkforceSKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoGenerative AI"},"6623fe12965238ab3060f61f7f9188a0":{"url":"https://fs.blog/smart-decisions/","title":"","description":"Learning to make smart decisions helps you get better results.

It is always about what they want from the other person. They don’t have an answer to why the other person should be remotely interested in connecting with them. There are dozens of threads on Twitter on how to send a killer mail/DM. They won’t read them. They would rather send a 100 more unanswered DMs. NPCs attend meetings without adding any value. They jump from one meeting to another. They also set up meetings. Tons of them. They never OWN a meeting though. NPCs are people who pass on second hand opinions of “Twitter experts” as their own thoughts. Instead of thinking deeply about a topic, they reply with threads that support their worldview. NPCs take pre assigned identity labels at birth and form their entire worldview based on them. They are on Twitter all day getting offended and fighting the “others”. NPCs are solid reply guys.

But under Jassy’s leadership, Amazon has not only sustained its momentum but accelerated. In this wide-ranging conversation with HBR’s editor at large, Jassy reflects on what it takes to get a behemoth like Amazon to operate like a startup and how he pushes his team to take chances. “If you aren’t failing,” he says, “you’re either not inventing enough or not pushing the envelope.” He explains his decision to get workers back to the office five days a week, why he’s working to flatten the organization, and how Amazon is embracing AI. An optimist by nature, Jassy predicts that AI will transform the customer experience, but he’s clear-eyed about the challenges that accompany rapid technological change.","content_snippet":"“Speed Is a Leadership Decision”SKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoLeadership“Speed Is a Lea"},"6ac96d6580111c1a652781f778b41a00":{"url":"https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-startup-dilemma-move-slow-or-break-things/","title":"The Software Development Dilemma: Move Fast without Breaking Things? - The Pragmatic Engineer","description":"","content_snippet":"The Software Development Dilemma: Move Fast without Breaking Things? - The Pragmatic Engineer Menu C"},"6ace23e760b76dae75069b3896a6e0f4":{"url":"https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/container-queries-unleashed/","title":"Container Queries Unleashed • Josh W.

They’re so powerful that, increasingly, companies aren’t setting them alone but sharing the fight with government regulators, civil society groups, and internal standards bodies like Meta’s Oversight Board.

And when your style suddenly loses its desired impact, it can be hard to know how to shift it without losing your authenticity or confusing those you lead. Here are five strategies to help you successfully meet the moment when your default leadership style stops working: 1) Scan for shifts in the business, stakeholders, and yourself. 2) Identify a style you’re overusing and try on new ones. 3) Be transparent about style changes. 4) Practice, seek feedback, and expect pushback. 5) Commit to developing versatility over mastery.","content_snippet":"When Your Go-To Leadership Style Stops WorkingSKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoLeadership "},"735b97465adf22d597e859e8c05bcc25":{"url":"https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/open-mainframe-project-announces-schedule-for-ibm-techxchange-conference-on-october-21-2024","title":"Open Mainframe Project Announces Schedule for IBM TechXchange Conference on October 21, 2024","description":"Discover the schedule for the Open Mainframe Project's sessions at IBM TechXchange Conference 2024.

His point was that most crypto startups hire builders while he is a PM. Why would anyone in web3 hire him. What value can he add? My argument was “How many people have worked at a startup at scale and one that has been invested by Google?” The value he will add as someone who helped a startup scale is unparalleled. The startup he worked at is known by everyone in India. And for web3 startups it is always a positive story if they can hire more builders who have moved from web2; it further validates their hypotheses that what they are working on is actually the future.","content_snippet":"The stories we tell | Manas J.

The industry is moving from hardware to software in the form of smart, connected elevators. But instead of laying off legacy hardware staff and hiring new talent, the CEO wants to offer the employees a “Grand Bargain”: The company will pay for voluntary reskilling and retraining, but the workers will need to take responsibility for their own futures. Those who opt in will gain valuable skills and have a future with the company; those who don’t may face demotions and pay cuts. However, there is pushback from the company’s shareholders and leaders. Some want to use the program as a fig leaf for laying off staff; others think it costs too much and might put the company at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies that are hiring technologically skilled people right away. Leaders are worried that longtime workers will balk at learning these new skills and end up quitting, causing the company to lose hundreds of years of cumulative experience. The CEO is now unsure of how to proceed.","content_snippet":"Case Study: Do We Reskill or Replace Our Workforce?SKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoChange"},"7ab9e3312a2d4c03fd3fec04645ca689":{"url":"https://hbr.org/store/magazine-issues","title":"HBR Store - Magazines","description":"","content_snippet":"HBR Store - Magazines Magazine Issues Harvard Business Review is the foremost destination for smart "},"7ac3cd3527856a389eca7a8d2048d125":{"url":"https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/","title":"Common APIs Handbook | Developer.WordPress.org","description":"This handbook serves as a clearinghouse for documentation on all APIs present within the WordPress software as well as APIs available from&hellip;","content_snippet":"Common APIs Handbook | Developer.WordPress.org WordPress.org WordPress Developer Resources Common AP"},"7ac52d8d8133dd1c7e394843b8017213":{"url":"https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/finder-guide.md","title":"oss-vulnerability-guide/finder-guide.md at main · ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide · GitHub","description":"A guide on coordinated vulnerability disclosure for open source projects.

The industry is moving from hardware to software in the form of smart, connected elevators. But instead of laying off legacy hardware staff and hiring new talent, the CEO wants to offer the employees a “Grand Bargain”: The company will pay for voluntary reskilling and retraining, but the workers will need to take responsibility for their own futures. Those who opt in will gain valuable skills and have a future with the company; those who don’t may face demotions and pay cuts. However, there is pushback from the company’s shareholders and leaders. Some want to use the program as a fig leaf for laying off staff; others think it costs too much and might put the company at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies that are hiring technologically skilled people right away. Leaders are worried that longtime workers will balk at learning these new skills and end up quitting, causing the company to lose hundreds of years of cumulative experience. The CEO is now unsure of how to proceed.","content_snippet":"Case Study: Do We Reskill or Replace Our Workforce?SKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoChange"},"857f1175e5b539d9da48ba9d03a6ed9b":{"url":"https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/tag/deep-research","title":"Blog | Linux Foundation | Deep Research","description":"Deep Research | Check out Linux Foundation's Blog","content_snippet":"Blog | Linux Foundation | Deep Research Open Source Summit North America · Jun 23-25 · Denver REGIST"},"85826ca7c723db464ccea58398e1641a":{"url":"https://medium.com/free-code-camp/how-to-easily-implement-qrcoder-in-asp-net-core-using-c-10c4aa857e84?source=collection_home---6------0-----------------------","title":"How to easily implement QRCoder in ASP.NET Core using C# | by Yogi | We’ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/news | Medium","description":"QRCoder is a very popular QR Code implementation library written in C#.

Saloi","description":"Angel investing is a stupid way to make money. Most companies fail. Even those invested in by top VCs. It is a power law business. How VCs make money is spreading their bets, and then doubling down on the few winners using reserves. And angels/ seed stage investors raise SPVs to do follow on rounds. There are two things to consider when it comes to investing in startups: Upside maximisation and downside protection. Upside maximisation: Most VCs put in a pro rata clause in the term sheet so that they get the right to invest in follow on rounds. They have access to reserves so that they can double down on winners. They have access to sell secondaries. Downside protection: Late stage investors have liquidation preference. An angel has none of this. A few one off bets will just lead to them burning money. So why do angel investors still put in money? Vanity/ Status: The sweet Twitter and Linkedin bio update. Pointless when you can put a 1L check in a startup and get this status. Money: They think they will make money. As I explained earlier, it is very hard. Now let’s come to some underrated reasons. Reasons why someone should do angel investing. Supporting the ecosystem: You get to invest and support smart founders and help build the future. I know it sounds like virtue signalling, but a lot of smart angels/ early stage VCs actually write checks because of it. They have made their money and they want to give back. Optionality: A lot of VCs end up joining their portfolio companies. You get access to insider info, build a relationship with the founders and if you see a rocket you can jump.The HOP at Craftsvilla, was an ex VC. So was the Head of Merchandise and the Head of Strategy. The team was full of ex VCs. A lot of friends I have in the VC industry are people who worked at VC firms and then became operators. You get to live multiple lives. Let’s face it, even if you work for a startup, you are on a single path. Let’s say you work at Razorpay, one of the hottest tradfi companies, and you are a Director. You are on a rocketship, fintech is hot, you are compensated well, and you have status too. But the problem is that you can’t stop thinking about crypto. The easiest way to explore, is to invest very small checks (let’s say 1-2 L) in 5 web3 startups. If you are a smart operator, startups would love to have you, especially with your fintech experience. You are down, what? 1-2 months salary? It is nothing in the long run. Now you can spend your nights post work and weekends working with these founders, helping them, building a relationship. And once you have conviction, you can jump by either starting up or joining one of these portfolio companies. - Investing opens multiple futures: Maybe you just want to understand different industries. You can sign up on Angellist or Letsventure and start reading memos sent by various fund managers. For this you don’t even need to invest. Just sign up. Be a Shark Tank judge without investing. Now you can start writing your own thesis on various startups. Play fantasy VC. Turner Novak did this years back. As someone living in the middle of fucking nowhere, it was his way of building credibility. Do this If you want to get into VC, but don’t have money or credibility yet. - You can’t stop thinking about startups: A lot of my friends invest in startups because they want to do more. Spending time with founders on weekends gives them energy. And they want to learn about various industries without reading books. Think of it like a cheaper MBA. - Build reputation in a region: A friend who moved to SE Asia has invested in close to 5 startups. This has opened up a new network for him. He has access to far more contacts in the region than he would have normally. Intro’ing becomes easier. Without knowing your value add, people are reluctant to talk to you. Especially in a new region. His founders will now introduce my friend as ‘Hey meet X, operator in Y startup + an angel in my company’ to their other founder friends and VCs. This opens up the opportunity to invest in other companies. And more career opportunities. - Show skin in the game: Want to get into VC later in your career? Invest small checks. Show judgement and value you can add to portfolio companies. - Angel investing is a 10 years+ game: A friend of mine is investing 20% of his salary every year writing angel checks. And he plans to do it for 10 years. He would have a portfolio of 50-100 companies by the end of these 10 years. He is playing a long game.Don’t do this if you want to optimise on short term returns or just to update Linkedin. Now let’s come to why I have decided to do it. I have done only 3 deals till now. But I am talking to a lot of VCs and friends who angel invest. I have been somewhat lucky with the startup game. No big exits, but some liquidity. I have lived with a scarcity mindset for a long long time. I was worried that I would lose my job, become homeless, and might have to move back with my parents. I have had the chance to invest in at least 5 companies started by friends that have raised follow on investing or are in the process of raising. But I said No. I let my money lie in a savings account yes, a fucking savings account because I kept thinking that I am living in a dream world. What I have got in life is too good to be true. The bubble will burst, there will be a great depression, and I will have to go back to my savings. This is nothing new. My friends whose offers to invest I declined know this. Now that I have a number in the bank account that makes me sleep well at night (it is not that big, my needs are limited), I want to get away from my scarcity mindset. I was talking to a friend recently who is a very smart VC and someone I have respected for years. We were talking about mindset and he told me something illuminating. While I am always default No, think ways something can fail, he is the extreme opposite. He always thinks “It will work bhai, why won’t it work?” He is an eternal optimist. A real one. Not performing-on-Twitter-to-sell-shitcoins optimist. He is the same person who told me years back that his life is like Forest Gump jumping from one interesting opportunity to another, while I do Pros and Cons of going to the bathroom to pee vs waiting another 15 mins. (Okay, last bit I added, he did not say that.) So what I am saying is that I want change my mindset from ‘holy shit, this is the end’ to ‘wagmi’. I don’t have to worry about deals. I get enough inbounds already. If I had only invested in my friends, I would have had good markups already. Yes, I am privileged and lucky to know many smart people. And I should take advantage of it. And my founder friends will be happy. They have been asking me to invest for years. I want to put my money where my mouth is. Show some skin in the game. Yes, my check sizes will be small. I am still risk averse. And yes, my friends don’t even need my money, but I want to show them my support beyond reviewing pitch docs and giving product gyaan. What is the point of me reading 100 books a year, bookmarking 10000 blogposts, listening to a dozen investing podcasts a week, if I just read and listen and not do anything. I have worked on enterprise bots/secure communication, ad tech, e-commerce, messaging/ productivity, and now mobility. In India and now in SE Asia. B2B and B2C. I already help so many founders. Spend most weekends doing that. Investing seems like a natural extension. I have worked in both Product and Growth. So I can add value to founders. I know I mostly shitpost nowadays and don’t write about work enough, but in the last 3 years I have had the chance to see my company grow 10X. I lead growth and expansion for a BU that still does 100s of millions of transactions a year. [Probably more than most marketplaces in India.] That too during covid. I can sit and talk about marketplaces for hours. So why not use my knowledge instead of just shit posting here? How people get into angel investing and how I invest? 1L INR is the lowest one puts when writing angel checks. People who have made good money put like 10L and get on the cap table. If you put 1L/2L you have to go through syndicates but pay carry. I invest in no carry syndicates that founders run on AL and LV for friends. I can’t afford to put 10L each cheque. If angel investing is like Poker, and it is I think, I would need 100 buy-ins. 100 buy-ins mean 10Cr. I don’t have that. And if you can’t lose even 10L, I would say don’t start. Most investments will go to 0. It is the dumbest way to make money. I am lucky to be part of multiple networks. By network I mean Whatsapp groups and also DMs from friends who send me deals the invest in. If your source of deals is only AL or LV, you should probably wait and build your network first. Don’t fall into the mimesis trap of angel investing. Repeating again: Writing 1L checks won’t make you money or give status. I could have invested for years, but did not till I thought yeah, fuck it, I have some money now, let me take more risks. And I have a big network. I run a Whatsapp group called Dhaniya Ventures where I share deals with well connected friends from the ecosystem and in return I also get access to deals early. Don’t start investing till you have enough money and also a network to rely for deal flow.","content_snippet":"Thoughts on angel investing | Manas J.

But if those new segments have needs, values, and preferences that differ from current buyers’, that approach can backfire spectacularly, driving away a firm’s loyal base and shrinking revenues. Kohl’s, Starbucks, and Bud Light are among the many brands that have encountered this problem. Before targeting new customers, executives need to understand how they’ll interact with the old ones. The two critical factors are whether the two segments seek the same or different value from a brand and how sensitive they are to each other’s identities. Those factors combine to create four kinds of relationships: separate communities, connected communities, leader-follower segments, and incompatible segments. Each relationship type calls for different management strategies. However, most conflict emerges between incompatible segments. To resolve it, firms need to shift them to another type of relationship by building walls, creating hierarchies, or, in worst-case scenarios, firing one segment.","content_snippet":"Attract New Customers Without Alienating Your Old OnesSKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoCus"},"87cef6e0a6afbe5bc0a74f727dd43744":{"url":"https://budgetsaresexy.com/recommend/","title":"My Favorite Financial Resources: Apps, Books, Blogs &amp; More","description":"All of my favorite financial resources, blogs, apps, books, &amp; services, including banking, saving, investing, &amp; early retirement","content_snippet":"My Favorite Financial Resources: Apps, Books, Blogs & More A page of alllll my favorite financial re"},"87d86f002728e60c81c6c9e395066e67":{"url":"https://www.wired.com/category/politics/","title":"Politics News: US Elections, Global Elections, Tech Policy, Disinformation | WIRED","description":"Get in-depth coverage of politics news at WIRED including US elections, global elections, tech policy, and disinformation.","content_snippet":"Politics News: US Elections, Global Elections, Tech Policy, Disinformation | WIREDSkip to main conte"},"87db43dffdaec81788868fa8076e7f24":{"url":"https://bsky.app/profile/css-tricks.com","title":"@css-tricks.com on Bluesky","description":"* A website about making websites. https://css-tricks.com","content_snippet":"@css-tricks.com on Bluesky JavaScript Required This is a heavily interactive web application, and Ja"},"87e953cd3b3c9ad7d3b4eff903890481":{"url":"https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-and-openssf-release-report-on-the-state-of-education-in-secure-software-development","title":"The Linux Foundation and OpenSSF Release Report on the State of Education in Secure Software Development","description":"Findings show nearly one-third of industry professionals are not familiar with secure software development practices","content_snippet":"The Linux Foundation and OpenSSF Release Report on the State of Education in Secure Software Develop"},"87ee46dafbe5a5a70b273c6fed9f8d1b":{"url":"https://wordpress.org/playground/","title":"WordPress Playground","description":"","content_snippet":"WordPress Playground WordPress.org WordPress Playground WordPress in one click WordPress Playground "},"87f1b1bbae4aaa4b01a8599ea5cf3c3b":{"url":"https://paulgraham.com/pinch.html","title":"The Fatal Pinch","description":"","content_snippet":"The Fatal Pinch December 2014Many startups go through a point a few months before they die where alt"},"87f7d54701fe93071aa20af43ce092fd":{"url":"https://www.wired.com/story/lilly-obesity-pill-effective-orforglipron-injected-glp-1-ozempic/","title":"Eli Lilly’s Obesity Pill Appears to Work as Well as Injected GLP-1s | WIRED","description":"New data from a Phase 3 trial show that the daily anti-obesity pill may be as safe and effective as drugs like Mounjaro and Ozempic for weight loss and lowering blood sugar.","content_snippet":"Eli Lilly’s Obesity Pill Appears to Work as Well as Injected GLP-1s | WIREDSkip to main contentSecur"},"87fbb596ce30f387a763ee4170441a6e":{"url":"https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/press-release/linux-foundation-research-announces-software-bill-of-materials-sbom-readiness-survey","title":"Linux Foundation Research Announces Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Readiness Survey - Linux Foundation","description":"This SBOM readiness survey is the Linux Foundation’s first project addressing how to secure the software supply chain.","content_snippet":"Linux Foundation Research Announces Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Readiness Survey - Linux Found"},"8803dc5e6e2493dcd64436e26638a20d":{"url":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365","title":"Business Applications | Microsoft Dynamics 365","description":"Enter the era of AI-powered business with Dynamics 365—CRM and ERP business applications that connect your teams, processes, and data.","content_snippet":"Business Applications | Microsoft Dynamics 365 This is the Trace Id: 55918f94b897411fe3a1d558c054e5c"},"8809ef20234f171dc2267cfb39975481":{"url":"https://ghost.io/help/","title":"Ghost: The best open source blog & newsletter platform","description":"Beautiful, modern publishing with email newsletters and paid subscriptions built-in.

Saloi","description":"AI can: Help ICs do their current work: Better. For a PM, can their spec become better because now they can use tools like Deep Research (OpenAI) for competitor analysis, Deep Search (Twitter) for faster, efficient search? Can AI give insights about customer behavior and point out edge cases that a normal PM would miss? Can a copywriter now come up with dozens of copy variants that are probably far better than anything they could create on their own? Faster. Lead time: Can you cut the lead time to arrive at a spec and prototype? This is easier because you can leverage existing templates, turn notes into first-cut specs faster, and brainstorm with LLMs to think through ideas and stress test them. As a PM, you can work on quick prototypes before you collaborate with a designer on the solution. These will mostly have to be discarded. Tech leads can create their tech specs faster. AI won’t do the complete work for them, but previously the planning stage would take a lot of time. Now it is far faster to brainstorm, go broad, and then narrow in on a solution (diamond). Cycle time: Here it is trickier. Landing pages for marketing would be far faster. Marketers can probably do these on their own now. Stand-alone pages. You can create copy faster. If midway through the project execs change their mind, instead of the project being on hold until designers change their designs or add more scope, you can quickly use the designs to create a web prototype, make the changes, and show it, instead of making changes on the actual app. [I wish this did not happen, but ask any company, and they will tell you scope changes and design changes, especially in startups, happen quite a bit.] For a senior engineer, tab tab tab works because even in a big codebase, you are not using the agent to make changes across multiple files. Scaffolding is taken care of. Just don’t expect some 90% improvement though. It is not going to happen unless you want to go full Yolo mode and spend months refactoring later. More. If you are doing better and faster work, a person is already delivering more. So they can manage more projects at a time and also take less time per project. Since you can generate potentially infinite variants of copy and designs, you can create far more marketing campaigns than before. You can try many more landing pages. You can test different funnels for different segments. Marissa Mayer used to test 40 shades of blue for a button. AI gives you the same power, without needing the resources of a Google. Empower an IC to take on completely new work not possible before: This is the most exciting part of this AI age. A marketer is now a copywriter. A PM, instead of waiting for a data analyst for complex queries, can do their own analysis. A marketer can create designs for their campaigns using various design tools. A PM can make prototypes while collaborating with their business counterparts or engineers, leaving the designer to do deep work on their current projects. A backend developer working on an internal dashboard does not need to wait for a designer. They can use v0 for it. They don’t even need to wait for a front-end dev. They can use v0 again. Do note: These tools are good for standalone projects with smaller code bases. You can’t expect these gen AI tools to write scalable code, and as the code base increases, it will hallucinate more and might even want to delete your own codebase for the lols. Help teams coordinate better: There are tons of meeting notes and action item products. No meeting should end without a Minutes of Meeting (MOM) now. People hate writing. An email takes effort. Even a Slack update requires work. Superhuman has autocomplete. Gmail has summaries. You don’t need to wait 3 days to reply to an email going forward. Replies might be templated and get shorter, but people will not become bottlenecks (hopefully). Enable Push vs Pull: This is my favorite topic and something I have written a lot about. Push »»»&gt; Pull. All PMs pretend to like data. But no one opens Tableau every day to check data. An email update means you are not pulling data anymore, and it is delivered to your inbox. Earlier you would wait for a data analyst to create a new email, but maybe now you can do it yourself. Or the data analyst can be more productive and create a new insights email and not need a week to get it done. What are the insights people need to do their job better? How can we push them in a timely manner with clear action items? Facebook campaign performance is declining? Is there an email with updates about that, with insights on why that might be happening, along with 5 more suggested campaign ideas? Push 10X more content on your distribution channels: Use your distribution to your advantage. Create more AI-generated videos. Create memes. Post replies on other channels. Maybe create a completely new channel with only AI videos. More thoughts: 90% and not 100%: The more specific the output, the harder it is for AI to get it done. It is a next token predictor after all. This is why I can come up with a dozen ideas for a wedding card (yes, I tried this for a friend), and the characters can seem like them, use style and character reference, but for some reason or another, the hands will be messed up on Midjourney. Yes, I can use Replicate and try out more models, but each incremental rerun costs money. This is what companies will learn too. So the best use cases are where you don’t need 100% accuracy, but are okay with 90%. You might want creative ad ideas. You might want creative landing pages. You might want nice graphics. But be happy with 90%. If you try to make it 100%, you might end up spending as much time as before on Photoshop and you won’t get the productivity gains you were expecting. Workflows: I would do an audit of workflow of each person working for my company and understand how they can leverage these tools to do more work at a faster pace, and can take on adjacent work. Existing tools vs in-house tools: I tried this experiment a while back. I was trying to see if I can create a MiniManas, use AI to write like me. I have 500 blog posts on my site. I started with just asking all the chat tools to write like me without example. I then tried to use better prompts. Asked ChatGPT to update its memory on how to write like me. Used Claude’s styles. Then I gave an example in the prompt. Gave some notes. Then I tried to give examples of drafts vs final output, and played around with the number of examples and final output. Then with the help of a friend, I fine-tuned a model and tried the same exercise. Next would have been to use some RAG-based system to create embeddings of all my written content, chats or blogs, store them in some vector store, and then use different LLMs to write like me. I tried the first part, but the embeddings workflow was failing. And I was too poor to use OpenAI’s embeddings API. I gave up at this point. My point with the above is that you can try all sorts of solutions. But instead of trying to fine-tune some LLM and creating your own workflows, see if you can use an existing tool. You don’t need to fine-tune some LLM to write code. You are not JaneStreet who needs Ocaml and needs their in-house tab tab tab. You can just use Cursor. Yes, you might have a particular design system and brand guidelines, but that does not mean you need custom loras to generate images for a brand campaign. You can just try prompt engineering and get 90% there. Post an existing brand image on ChatGPT or Grok. Ask them to describe the image. Use the description and reference image to create more brand images on Midjourney. Take it to Magnific AI to upscale. You can even use a mix of Midjourney + Figma. Instead of creating custom in-house agentic workflow, maybe try some off-the-shelf available agent workflow builders. I particularly love what a founder told me: His goal is to make sure every employee in the middle of the bell curve gets superpowers and can do their job like an A player. I think that is a nice way to think about this transition.","content_snippet":"AI adoption inside companies | Manas J. Saloi AI can: Help ICs do their current work: Better.

As models grow more powerful, any task that can be turned into data—from spreadsheet analysis to therapy sessions—is increasingly within reach of automation. The underlying playbook is clear: define the task, feed it data, attach rewards, and apply compute. As AI slashes the cost of measurement, even minor activities become economically viable to automate, expanding the reach of AI into nearly every industry. What remains defensible are tasks defined by ambiguity, creativity, or uncertainty—places where outcomes can’t be easily quantified or where human judgment still prevails. For leaders, the challenge is to manage both the measurable and the unmeasurable, investing not just in automation, but in the intangibles—taste, trust, vision, and adaptability—that AI can’t yet replicate.","content_snippet":"What Gets Measured, AI Will AutomateSKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoAI and machine learni"},"8f518de1ae2b3dbc3d2d027504f31ff7":{"url":"http://shop.waitbutwhy.com/","title":"The Official Wait But Why Store","description":"Free shipping to the US on orders of at least $30 through Friday, 12/1.","content_snippet":"The Official Wait But Why Store Men's Tees Tank Tops Sweatshirts Women's Tees Tees Racerback Kid's T"},"8f68080e07e15dc76943402a97a9eeab":{"url":"https://manassaloi.com/2022/04/26/hacking-career-liquidity.html","title":"Hacking your career to retire early | Manas J.

But without the right leadership, collaboration can go astray. Employees who try to collaborate on everything may wind up stuck in endless meetings, struggling to reach agreement. On the other side of the coin, executives who came of age during the heyday of “command and control” management can have trouble adjusting their style to fit the new realities. In their research on top-performing CEOs, Insead professors Ibarra and Hansen have examined what it takes to be a collaborative leader. They’ve found that it requires connecting people and ideas outside an organization to those inside it, leveraging diverse talent, modeling collaborative behavior at the top, and showing a strong hand to keep teams from getting mired in debate. In this article, they describe tactics that executives from Akamai, GE, Reckitt Benckiser, and other firms use in those four areas and how they foster high-performance collaborative cultures in their organizations.","content_snippet":"Are You a Collaborative Leader?SKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoLeadershipAre You a Collab"},"8f7d229e45dc7a4684441abea50c24c3":{"url":"https://hbr.org/magazine","title":"The Magazine - HBR","description":"Find new ideas and classic advice on strategy, innovation and leadership, for global leaders from the world's best business and management experts.","content_snippet":"The Magazine - HBR Skip to content The Magazine Subscribe Today Current Issue July–August 2025 The C"},"8f8da655751b70a09c5d3d0ca46a2f6e":{"url":"https://www.wired.com/category/science/","title":"Science News: Health, Robotics, Climate Change, Space News | WIRED","description":"Get in-depth science coverage at WIRED including news, the latest research and discoveries and how technology is shaping the world of science.","content_snippet":"Science News: Health, Robotics, Climate Change, Space News | WIREDSkip to main contentSecurityPoliti"},"8f90bb81554edf10655e4b713c02719b":{"url":"https://seths.blog/2025/06/perfect-3/","title":"Perfect | Seth&#039;s Blog","description":"Seth Godin&#039;s Blog on marketing, tribes and respect","content_snippet":"Perfect | Seth's Blog You have unread updates 0 Search Search for: Or try my new AI-powered search b"},"8f912e25fec48fc4939fc53789457870":{"url":"https://tympanus.net/codrops/2025/06/16/inside-the-frontier-of-ai-webxr-real-time-3d-crafting-kode-immersive/","title":"Inside the Frontier of AI, WebXR &amp; Real-Time 3D: Crafting KODE Immersive | Codrops","description":"A behind-the-scenes look at how bold vision and emerging tech shaped a boundary-pushing digital experience.","content_snippet":"Inside the Frontier of AI, WebXR & Real-Time 3D: Crafting KODE Immersive | Codrops Meco is a distrac"},"8f91b26b5186926bdccb4fae7f827c59":{"url":"https://blog.documentfoundation.org/","title":"The Document Foundation Blog - The home of LibreOffice","description":"The home of LibreOffice","content_snippet":"The Document Foundation Blog - The home of LibreOffice 20 Jun 2025 The Open Document Format (ODF) is"},"8f91dabb1f43c350547d6845ecdce2e1":{"url":"https://wordpress.org/documentation/category/dashboard/","title":"Dashboard &#8211; Documentation &#8211; WordPress.org","description":"Posts about Dashboard written by Akira Tachibana, pixelateddwarf, Kartik Shukla, annezazu, Jesse Owens, william68, Howdy_McGee, Yuli Yang, Mehul Gohil, Milana Cap, Animesh Gaurav (a11n), and Antonio Villegas","content_snippet":"Dashboard – Documentation – WordPress.org WordPress.org Documentation Dashboard Administration Scree"},"8f93ea82affac9705ba8c0c83c1cc169":{"url":"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/02/09/mary-oliver-blue-horses-fourth-sign-of-the-zodiac/","title":"Mary Oliver on the Measure of a Life Well Lived and How to Magnify Your Aliveness &#8211; The Marginalian","description":"","content_snippet":"Mary Oliver on the Measure of a Life Well Lived and How to Magnify Your Aliveness – The Marginalian "},"8f9628bd271bc790b646ee7aeea243b4":{"url":"https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/12/08/a-debugging-manifesto/","title":"A debugging manifesto","description":"A debugging manifesto","content_snippet":"A debugging manifesto Skip to main content Hello!

Recent advances in agentic AI bring that autonomous future a step closer to reality. With their supercharged reasoning and execution capabilities, agentic AI systems promise to transform many aspects of human-machine collaboration. The agentic AI prize could be great, with the promise of greater productivity, innovation and insights for the human workforce. But so, too, are the risks: the potential for bias, mistakes, and inappropriate use. Early action by business and government leaders now will help set the right course for agentic AI development, so that its benefits can be achieved safely and fairly.","content_snippet":"What Is Agentic AI, and How Will It Change Work?SKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoGenerativ"},"91a74bac18bd410c89f139f2f9099ad3":{"url":"https://css-tricks.com/books/greatest-css-tricks/scroll-shadows/","title":"Scroll Shadows - CSS-Tricks","description":"Perhaps my favorite CSS trick of all time!

But that is a far cry from replacing shareholder capitalism as the central organizing principle for U.S. companies. For that to happen, much more is required. Proponents will need to define more clearly what stakeholder capitalism is, strengthen its theoretical foundations, and develop a playbook for implementing it, including metrics for measuring performance and guidelines for making tradeoffs. They will also need to build an ecosystem of investors, executives, directors, advisors, and other professionals (lawyers, bankers, accountants, analysts, and so on) who understand and support it, embed its precepts in law and regulation, and educate future leaders in its tenets and practices.","content_snippet":"The Business Roundtable’s Stakeholder Pledge, Five Years LaterSKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review"},"951653cf0bda4136fbda18d2d0e638d3":{"url":"https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/07/05/saturday-comics/","title":"saturday comics: a weekly mailing list of programming comics","description":"saturday comics: a weekly mailing list of programming comics","content_snippet":"saturday comics: a weekly mailing list of programming comics Skip to main content Hello!

In an analysis of 654 presentations on acquisitions, two professors found one factor that stood out: whether a compelling visualization of the strategic rationale for the deal was included. Unfortunately, they discovered, the majority of strategic visualizations aren’t designed to have impact. In this article the professors explain why visualizations are so important to the communication of strategy and describe how to create one that will win buy-in from employees and investors alike. By combining insights from research on how the brain processes information with their study of deal presentations and experiments testing people’s responses to various visual approaches, they have identified five critical design principles: Group ideas into three or four main concepts, create layers with increasing detail, use color and shading only to distinguish the layers, indicate a clear sequence of relationships among the elements, and present information horizontally.","content_snippet":"You Should Be Able to Boil Your Strategy Down to a Single Clear VisualizationSKIP TO CONTENTHarvard "},"9d8ba10e4067cc30f42c1905f3db7752":{"url":"https://overreacted.io/how-does-setstate-know-what-to-do/","title":"How Does setState Know What to Do? — overreacted","description":"Dependency injection is nice if you don’t have to think about it.","content_snippet":"How Does setState Know What to Do? — overreactedHow Does setState Know What to Do?December 9, 2018Pa"},"9d8e63fb42baf494a95a5db6de9e2db2":{"url":"https://stratechery.com/2021/intel-problems/","title":"Intel Problems &#8211; Stratechery by Ben Thompson","description":"","content_snippet":"Intel Problems – Stratechery by Ben Thompson Intel Problems Tuesday, January 19, 2021 One of the fir"},"9d8ef302528fa3e24207891ae70ffc37":{"url":"https://code.facebook.com/legal/cookie-policy","title":"Page not found - Engineering at Meta","description":"","content_snippet":"Page not found - Engineering at Meta Skip to content We recently migrated the Code engineering blog."},"9d90b6827ed904399354488b99074a4b":{"url":"https://enable-javascript.com/","title":"How to enable JavaScript in your browser and why","description":"Instructions on how to enable (activate) JavaScript in web browser and why.","content_snippet":"How to enable JavaScript in your browser and why This website uses cookies to improve performance an"},"9d96593e6e1967f8ab8b40ce0e5f8171":{"url":"https://manassaloi.com/2025/01/27/deepseek-app.html","title":"Deepseek’s consumer app | Manas J.

It’s both a chance to continue to prove yourself and to find out whether a position is the right fit for you. In this piece, the author lists sample questions recommended by two career experts and divides them up by category: from how to learn more about your potential boss to how to learn more about a company’s culture. Choose the ones that are more relevant to you, your interests, and the specific job ahead of time. Then write them down — either on a piece of paper or on your phone — and glance at them right before your interview so that they’re fresh in your mind. And, of course, be mindful of the interviewer’s time. If you were scheduled to talk for an hour and they turn to you with five minutes left, choose two or three questions that are most important to you. You will always have more time to ask questions once you have the job offer in hand.","content_snippet":"38 Smart Questions to Ask in a Job InterviewSKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoJob interview"},"9de776704aee3887a7d310be91c0ac5c":{"url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-Kernel-Clang-LTO-Patches","title":"Google Posts Patches So The Linux Kernel Can Be LTO-Optimized By Clang - Phoronix","description":"A Google engineer has posted patches for review so that the mainline Linux kernel can be built with Link-Time Optimizations (LTO) by the LLVM Clang code compiler.","content_snippet":"Google Posts Patches So The Linux Kernel Can Be LTO-Optimized By Clang - Phoronix Articles & Reviews"},"9deb1130a2d1a0a12e29bc8c4c9bc5fe":{"url":"https://wordpress.org/news/category/design/","title":"Design &#8211; WordPress News","description":"","content_snippet":"Design – WordPress News WordPress.org News Design WordPress Themes Need More Weird: A Call for Creat"},"9df0c50347435e6999e684d79ac616f0":{"url":"https://piquelife.com/tim","title":"The Fermented Supertea Tim Ferriss Drinks Daily &ndash; Pique","description":"","content_snippet":"The Fermented Supertea Tim Ferriss Drinks Daily – Pique Skip to content Nandaka | Adaptogenic Coffee"},"9df3c1801ec174f9391a84e1ea8bc383":{"url":"https://medium.com/codex/about","title":"About CodeX – Medium","description":"Read more about CodeX.

But the trends continue, because leaders are missing the underlying problem that connects these symptoms: Many employees don’t feel that they matter to their employers, bosses, and colleagues. Mattering— a mainstay concept in psychology—is the experience of feeling significant to those around us because we feel valued and know that we add value. In this article the author shows leaders how to apply this concept in the workplace. First, leaders need to truly see and hear team members during daily interactions. They must also regularly affirm their people’s significance. And finally, senior leaders need to scale these skills up to the organizational level so that mattering becomes a cultural norm. These behaviors may seem like common sense, but they’ve ceased to be common practice in a world of brief digital communications and condescension toward soft skills, and they’re well worth relearning. The article includes three activities leaders can use to get started.","content_snippet":"The Power of Mattering at WorkSKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoManaging peopleThe Power of"},"a4386ad360c420b95068901e4f73e273":{"url":"https://opensource.googleblog.com/2012/","title":"Google Open Source Blog: 2012","description":"","content_snippet":"Google Open Source Blog: 2012 Google Open Source Blog The latest news from Google on open source rel"},"a438934d606b099cf583b3e6af117057":{"url":"https://dev.to/t/safeline","title":"Safeline - DEV Community","description":"safeline content on DEV Community","content_snippet":"Safeline - DEV Community Create Post 60 Posts Published Older #safeline posts 1 2 How to Troubleshoo"},"a43c3b2d5101c913608cf9f73c32063e":{"url":"https://manassaloi.com/2024/08/10/zepto-profitabity.html","title":"Zepto profitability | Manas J.

Like ride-sharing, these compact two-wheelers were eagerly adopted by riders, kicking off what is seen as a revolution in micromobility.

Unfortunately, the theory has also been widely misunderstood, and the “disruptive” label has been applied too carelessly anytime a market newcomer shakes up well-established incumbents. In this article, the architect of disruption theory, Clayton M. Christensen, and his coauthors correct some of the misinformation, describe how the thinking on the subject has evolved, and discuss the utility of the theory. They start by clarifying what classic disruption entails—a small enterprise targeting overlooked customers with a novel but modest offering and gradually moving upmarket to challenge the industry leaders. They point out that Uber, commonly hailed as a disrupter, doesn’t actually fit the mold, and they explain that if managers don’t understand the nuances of disruption theory or apply its tenets correctly, they may not make the right strategic choices. Common mistakes, the authors say, include failing to view disruption as a gradual process (which may lead incumbents to ignore significant threats) and blindly accepting the “Disrupt or be disrupted” mantra (which may lead incumbents to jeopardize their core business as they try to defend against disruptive competitors). The authors acknowledge that disruption theory has certain limitations. But they are confident that as research continues, the theory’s explanatory and predictive powers will only improve.","content_snippet":"What Is Disruptive Innovation?SKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoDisruptive innovationWhat I"},"b301e3c94611ee6b08e0fc4492f499f0":{"url":"https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/11/26/day-13--bptt---staring-at-graphs-a-lot/","title":"Day 13: BPTT, and debugging why a model isn&#39;t training is hard","description":"Day 13: BPTT, and debugging why a model isn&#39;t training is hard","content_snippet":"Day 13: BPTT, and debugging why a model isn't training is hard Skip to main content Hello!

But sometimes the blessing of a flexible schedule can turn into what feels like a curse when you don’t have enough time during normal work hours to get your job done. There are ways to be more strategic with your time. First, set realistic standards for what is “enough” at work and at home. Next, clarify where you add most value in both realms. Third, set boundaries, even if it makes others unhappy. Finally, define times where you’ll be really “on”—and really “off.”","content_snippet":"Is Your Flexible Schedule Burning You Out?SKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoFlex timeIs You"},"b559dfb517cd288f4b90225d22ec0704":{"url":"https://opensource.googleblog.com/2010/07/","title":"Google Open Source Blog: July 2010","description":"","content_snippet":"Google Open Source Blog: July 2010 Google Open Source Blog The latest news from Google on open sourc"},"b564372aa8aba9c8370dfe390a8451eb":{"url":"https://draft.dev/learn/php-blogs","title":"The Best PHP Blogs - Draft.dev","description":"Need quality PHP learning resources?

Delegating across means managing egos, politics, and invisible dynamics. Here are practical strategies for how to share the load and enlist the help you need, without overstepping: 1) Assess which tasks fit the bill. 2) Frame requests as partnerships. 3) Contract to create accountability. 4) Address pushback with curiosity. 5) Follow up without overstepping. At first, sideways delegation can feel slower and more cumbersome than handing something off to your team.

As models grow more powerful, any task that can be turned into data—from spreadsheet analysis to therapy sessions—is increasingly within reach of automation. The underlying playbook is clear: define the task, feed it data, attach rewards, and apply compute. As AI slashes the cost of measurement, even minor activities become economically viable to automate, expanding the reach of AI into nearly every industry. What remains defensible are tasks defined by ambiguity, creativity, or uncertainty—places where outcomes can’t be easily quantified or where human judgment still prevails. For leaders, the challenge is to manage both the measurable and the unmeasurable, investing not just in automation, but in the intangibles—taste, trust, vision, and adaptability—that AI can’t yet replicate.","content_snippet":"What Gets Measured, AI Will AutomateSKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoAI and machine learni"},"badc7459fb04abe03817d9b2b9a611e6":{"url":"https://markmanson.net/love","title":"Love Is Not Enough","description":"Love is great.

In an analysis of 654 presentations on acquisitions, two professors found one factor that stood out: whether a compelling visualization of the strategic rationale for the deal was included. Unfortunately, they discovered, the majority of strategic visualizations aren’t designed to have impact. In this article the professors explain why visualizations are so important to the communication of strategy and describe how to create one that will win buy-in from employees and investors alike. By combining insights from research on how the brain processes information with their study of deal presentations and experiments testing people’s responses to various visual approaches, they have identified five critical design principles: Group ideas into three or four main concepts, create layers with increasing detail, use color and shading only to distinguish the layers, indicate a clear sequence of relationships among the elements, and present information horizontally.","content_snippet":"You Should Be Able to Boil Your Strategy Down to a Single Clear VisualizationSKIP TO CONTENTHarvard "},"bdfa73b592a91a7ea40c3b4946d5cfe2":{"url":"https://jamesclear.com/creative-thinking","title":"Debunking the Eureka Moment: Creative Thinking Is a Process","description":"In this article, I’ll share the science of creative thinking, discuss which conditions drive creativity, and offer tips for becoming more creative.","content_snippet":"Debunking the Eureka Moment: Creative Thinking Is a Process Creativity Is a Process, Not an Event wr"},"bdfc64035e034a2028420724794e8f27":{"url":"https://pca.st/uqvvmt8t","title":"WordPress Briefing - A WordPress Podcast - Pocket Casts","description":"Listen to your favorite podcasts online, in your browser.

But if those new segments have needs, values, and preferences that differ from current buyers’, that approach can backfire spectacularly, driving away a firm’s loyal base and shrinking revenues. Kohl’s, Starbucks, and Bud Light are among the many brands that have encountered this problem. Before targeting new customers, executives need to understand how they’ll interact with the old ones. The two critical factors are whether the two segments seek the same or different value from a brand and how sensitive they are to each other’s identities. Those factors combine to create four kinds of relationships: separate communities, connected communities, leader-follower segments, and incompatible segments. Each relationship type calls for different management strategies. However, most conflict emerges between incompatible segments. To resolve it, firms need to shift them to another type of relationship by building walls, creating hierarchies, or, in worst-case scenarios, firing one segment.","content_snippet":"Attract New Customers Without Alienating Your Old OnesSKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoCus"},"bf659185958756cc85775a43eaaac0d0":{"url":"https://css-tricks.com/revisiting-image-maps/","title":"Revisiting Image Maps | CSS-Tricks","description":"Let’s run through a quick refresher.

To help employees rise to this challenge, the authors argue, employers need to step up, just as the majority have done for childcare, by providing more support in the form of new and expanded business policies, programs, and benefits. The business case for doing so is straightforward: Supporting elder caregivers improves productivity, retention, recruitment, and diversity. In this article the authors discuss who the providers of eldercare are, what demands they face, and what kinds of support they need most. The authors also provide examples of organizations that are leading the way in offering eldercare support to their employees. They conclude by providing some practical guidance to leaders who want their organizations to meet the challenges and opportunities of this demographic shift.","content_snippet":"Your Company Needs an Eldercare PolicySKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoWork-life balanceYo"},"c08054f57720b9d37932c335eda259b5":{"url":"https://www.nature.com/nature/videos","title":"Videos | Nature","description":"Watch the latest Videos from Nature","content_snippet":"Videos | Nature Skip to main content Thank you for visiting nature.com.

By contrast, fossil evidence attests to earlier migrations out of Africa10&#8211;15. These lines of evidence can only be reconciled if early dispersals made little to no genetic contribution to the later, major wave. A key question therefore concerns what factors facilitated the successful later dispersal that led to long-term settlement beyond Africa. Here we show that a notable expansion in human niche breadth within Africa precedes this later dispersal. We assembled a pan-African database of chronometrically dated archaeological sites and used species distribution models (SDMs) to quantify changes in the bioclimatic niche over the past 120,000&#8201;years. We found that the human niche began to expand substantially from 70&#8201;ka and that this expansion was driven by humans increasing their use of diverse habitat types, from forests to arid deserts. Thus, humans dispersing out of Africa after 50&#8201;ka were equipped with a distinctive ecological flexibility among hominins as they encountered climatically challenging habitats, providing a key mechanism for their adaptive success. Analysis of species distribution models in a pan-African database comprising chronometrically dated archaeological sites over the past 120,000&#8201;years shows major expansion in the human niche from 70&#8201;ka, driven by adaptation to diverse habitats.","content_snippet":"Major expansion in the human niche preceded out of Africa dispersal | Nature Skip to main content Th"},"c2e0e1f0dd751b5b5f9638658d500368":{"url":"https://lifehacker.com/home/household-items-to-use-as-garden-tools","title":"These Nine Household Items Make Great Garden Tools | Lifehacker","description":"If you&#039;ve ever been gardening and thought that the right tool was in your kitchen or workshop, lean into that.

And when your style suddenly loses its desired impact, it can be hard to know how to shift it without losing your authenticity or confusing those you lead. Here are five strategies to help you successfully meet the moment when your default leadership style stops working: 1) Scan for shifts in the business, stakeholders, and yourself. 2) Identify a style you’re overusing and try on new ones. 3) Be transparent about style changes. 4) Practice, seek feedback, and expect pushback. 5) Commit to developing versatility over mastery.","content_snippet":"When Your Go-To Leadership Style Stops WorkingSKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoLeadership "},"c3a940d4fd93e67a3a781a8e24780a1c":{"url":"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-loops-work-in-php-beginners-guide/","title":"How Loops Work in PHP: A Complete Guide for Beginners","description":"PHP loops help you repeat a block of code based on a condition.

We were looking to solve several infrastructure problems that had come up around that time. We were looking for a reliable way to collect event data and send it to our data warehouse. We were considering a more service-oriented architecture, and needed a standardized way of message passing between the components. We were starting to evaluate containerization of Shopify, and were searching for a way to get logs out of containers. We were intrigued by Kafka due to its highly available design. However, Kafka runs on the JVM, and its primary user, LinkedIn, runs a full JVM stack. Shopify is mainly Ruby on Rails and Go, so we had to figure out how to integrate Kafka into our infrastructure.","content_snippet":"Kafka Producer Pipeline for Ruby on Rails - ShopifySkip to Contentblog|InfrastructureKafka Producer "},"c999f02087298409ab04c1b4c17c9b64":{"url":"https://opensource.googleblog.com/2014/01/","title":"Google Open Source Blog: January 2014","description":"","content_snippet":"Google Open Source Blog: January 2014 Google Open Source Blog The latest news from Google on open so"},"c9a314a3877b5263219f96fb7ff70e42":{"url":"https://tim.blog/category/e-mail-detox/","title":"429 Too Many Requests","description":"","content_snippet":"429 Too Many Requests 429 Too Many Requests You have been rate-limited for making too many requests "},"c9b331f826ea97c03d0089f0f5c17331":{"url":"https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/press-release/sigstore-the-free-digital-signing-service-for-open-source-supply-chain-security-gets-additional-support","title":"sigstore, the free digital signing service for open source supply chain security, gets additional support - Linux Foundation","description":"Open source software tools and services are often created quickly and out of necessity.

Many firms, however, don’t have the option to bring employees back on-site, for a variety of reasons: They no longer have sufficient office space to house everyone, their employees are now dispersed geographically, or they fear a rebellion by hard-to-replace talent. But few leaders in those situations have faced this reality: You can’t effectively manage remote and hybrid workers using the same methods you did when employees were still all together in the office.

Even within the well-studied context of US agriculture, some analyses argue that adaptation will be widespread and climate damages small3,4, whereas others conclude that adaptation will be limited and losses severe5,6. Scenario-based analyses indicate that adaptation should have notable consequences on global agricultural productivity7&#8211;9, but there has been no systematic study of how extensively real-world producers actually adapt at the global scale. Here we empirically estimate the impact of global producer adaptations using longitudinal data on six staple crops spanning 12,658 regions, capturing two-thirds of global crop calories. We estimate that global production declines 5.5&amp;nbsp;&#215;&#8201;1014&#8201;kcal annually per 1 &#176;C global mean surface temperature (GMST) rise (120&#8201;kcal per person per day or 4.4% of recommended consumption per 1 &#176;C; P&#8201;&amp;lt;&#8201;0.001). We project that adaptation and income growth alleviate 23% of global losses in 2050 and 34% at the end of the century (6% and 12%, respectively; moderate-emissions scenario), but substantial residual losses remain for all staples except rice. In contrast to analyses of other outcomes that project the greatest damages to the global poor10,11, we find that global impacts are dominated by losses to modern-day breadbaskets with favourable climates and limited present adaptation, although&amp;nbsp;losses in low-income&amp;nbsp;regions losses are also substantial. These results indicate a scale of innovation, cropland expansion or further adaptation that might be necessary to ensure food security in a changing climate. Analysis of data on six stable crops, capturing two-thirds of global crop calories, allows estimation of&amp;nbsp;agricultural impacts and the potential of global producer adaptations to reduce&amp;nbsp;output losses owing to climate change.","content_snippet":"Impacts of climate change on global agriculture accounting for adaptation | Nature Skip to main cont"},"caf8fe63c1b136ae00315e58100904d4":{"url":"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/functions/","title":"Azure Functions – Serverless Functions in Computing | Microsoft Azure","description":"Create event-driven, scalable serverless applications in .NET, Node.js, Python, Java, or PowerShell with the Azure Functions app— a serverless computing service.","content_snippet":"Azure Functions – Serverless Functions in Computing | Microsoft Azure This is the Trace Id: c9986e00"},"caf9245071e9aba055f30fb8ad3e5fbe":{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBPa2Y_7Ps4","title":"&#39;Resulting&#39;: Don’t mistake a bad outcome for a bad decision | Annie Duke | Big Think - YouTube","description":"&#39;Resulting&#39;: Don’t mistake a bad outcome for a bad decisionWatch the newest video from Big Think: https://bigth.ink/NewVideoJoin Big Think Edge for exclusive...","content_snippet":"'Resulting': Don’t mistake a bad outcome for a bad decision | Annie Duke | Big Think - YouTubeAboutP"},"cb09efcf3b40f60f9cfdd999a0e285a4":{"url":"https://levelup.gitconnected.com/@fjzavala","title":"Francisco Zavala – Medium","description":"Read writing from Francisco Zavala on Medium.

Nsima Inyang (@nsimainyang) is a strength athlete, movement coach, and co-host of Mark Bell’s Power Project, one of the top fitness podcasts in the world. He is also one of the most freakishly athletic humans I’ve ever met. He’s a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, a professional natural bodybuilder (placed top five in the world), and an elite-level powerlifter (750-plus-pound deadlift, etc.)—but what sets him apart is how he blends all those worlds with unconventional training tools like kettlebells, maces, sandbags, and rope flow. Nsima is also the founder of The Stronger Human, a growing online community focused on strength, movement, and resilience.This episode is brought to you by:Pique premium pu’er tea crystals: https://piquelife.com/tim (20% off—valid for the lifetime of your subscription—plus a free Starter Kit, which includes a rechargeable frother and glass beaker)Momentous high-quality supplements: https://livemomentous.com/tim (code TIM for up to 35% off)Eight Sleep Pod Cover 5 sleeping solution for dynamic cooling and heating: EightSleep.com/Tim (use code TIM to get $350 off your very own Pod 5 Ultra.)*Watch the interview on YouTube: https://youtu.be/mLGqrlxofXANsima&#x27;s YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/nsimaInyangThe Stronger Human: https://www.skool.com/thestrongerhuman/aboutThe Stronger Human Store: https://thestrongerhuman.store/*Timestamps:[00:00:00] Start.[00:07:57] Defining powerlifting and Nsima’s elite totals.[00:10:30] Nsima’s first video that grabbed my attention.[00:11:26] Serge Gracovetsky and The Spinal Engine.[00:12:18] How Nsima avoids the distinctive plane-bound movement of many bodybuilders.[00:16:45] My tango struggles and coping with the “waist of a chicken.”[00:18:12] Intro to rope flow and David Weck.[00:20:15] Rope flow benefits, mechanics, and efficacy as an internal martial art.[00:35:21] Minimum effective dose rope flow.[00:37:37] Rope flow equipment and costs.[00:39:31] Bill Maeda and movement as daily practice.[00:42:38] How my three years of chronic pain and movement limitations might have been solved by breathing properly.[00:48:53] Lower body training: unilateral before bilateral, sandbags vs. barbells.[00:52:29] Box squats and safety: managing compression sensitivity and range of motion.[00:58:37] Set rep programming for non-elite powerlifters.[01:05:12] Eschew the monotonous.

In an analysis of 654 presentations on acquisitions, two professors found one factor that stood out: whether a compelling visualization of the strategic rationale for the deal was included. Unfortunately, they discovered, the majority of strategic visualizations aren’t designed to have impact. In this article the professors explain why visualizations are so important to the communication of strategy and describe how to create one that will win buy-in from employees and investors alike. By combining insights from research on how the brain processes information with their study of deal presentations and experiments testing people’s responses to various visual approaches, they have identified five critical design principles: Group ideas into three or four main concepts, create layers with increasing detail, use color and shading only to distinguish the layers, indicate a clear sequence of relationships among the elements, and present information horizontally.","content_snippet":"You Should Be Able to Boil Your Strategy Down to a Single Clear VisualizationSKIP TO CONTENTHarvard "},"cf29b68348d46bcd108e955e4289624e":{"url":"https://tealfeed.com/scheduling","title":"","description":"","content_snippet":"The page you are looking for does not seem to exist.( Unless you are looking for a confused person w"},"cf30e59c448bd0a931b9ecadbe75c3f6":{"url":"https://www.digitalocean.com/company/contact/sales?referrer=tophat","title":"Contact Sales at DigitalOcean","description":"Get in touch with our team to help scale and migrate your applications to DigitalOcean.","content_snippet":"Contact Sales at DigitalOceanWhy work with DigitalOcean?We are on a mission to help our customers fo"},"cf357a9d04d023a460b277e6136c64ec":{"url":"https://dev.to/arshtechpro","title":"ArshTechPro - DEV Community","description":"A mobile expert primarily focused on the iOS ecosystem.

Saloi","description":"“I’ve talked to a lot of the main researchers in the field. The way I think about it is almost like LLM steps. And when you had GPT-3.5, and you went to 4, suddenly legal opened up as a vertical. I backed a company called Harvey, and they showed me side-by-side 2.5 versus 4, 3.5 doesn’t work. It just doesn’t work. You had a model update, suddenly you could do legal. What’s the next step? You have these steps, and so it’s this ladder that you’re climbing. And eventually, you’re going to get to a point where it can do all of human services. And I don’t know if that’s GPT-7 equivalent, or 8, or 6, or 10, or whatever, but we’re going to get there. So you really don’t think of it in terms of man-machine symbiosis stuff. Like stuff we’re building now to do these services and win. Will those companies still be valuable in five years, because they can replace it with AI as it goes along? Or is it going to be something new? It’s going to be OpenAI itself that just owns all of those things that I was talking about. You know, it’s interesting. When I diligence Harvey, I called a bunch of big law firms. And I asked them, how do you think about this? And law firms, traditionally, are some of the worst software buyers in the world, right? They don’t really innovate. They’re locked down because of security, and privacy, and other very legitimate reasons. But they tend to be very bad buyers. But they were adopting Harvey really quickly. And so I asked them, how do you view the future of AI? What do you think is going to happen? And I was surprised by how thoughtful and forward-thinking they were on this, where they said, look, we think the nature of a law firm will change. Because right now, we hire, I’m making it up, 50 associates every year. And five of them will make it to partner. But we now think that, in a couple of years, we can just hire five associates to begin with. But then who becomes our partners? What do they learn along the way? How do we teach them? How do we screen them? How do we have a portfolio of people so that some work out and some don’t? And so they’re thinking about the legacy of their law firms. And they’re like, we don’t know how to think about this future world. But it also means maybe you have one senior partner, and two associates, and 30 bots. And so the whole thing kind of shifts.”","content_snippet":"Elad Gil on investing in AI | Manas J.

I first interviewed Shawn in 2019. Back then, Shawn had quit his $350k a year finance job and taught himself to code using freeCodeCamp. He was working as a full stack engineer. It's a wild interview that you should go back and listen to... after of course you finish listening this. Now a lot of people thought Shawn was crazy leaving finance. But this dude knew what he was doing. He has now risen through the ranks as a developer at tech startups. And now he's starting an AI startup of his own. He's already off to a strong start, having raised a $3 million pre-seed round from investors. This is the first time I've ever invited a guest return to the freeCodeCamp podcast for a second interview. And there was so much to talk about, I feel like I could have interviewed Shawn for days. The man has been eating, sleeping, and breathing AI engineering for the past year. I learned so much from talking with him. I'm confident that you will, too.

Saloi","description":"I have a lot of simple systems that helps me save time. For example, I have followed the same systems to write my performance reviews over the last few years. What do I do? I have a standard format where I just dump data points on impact. All the updates around impact of my projects are already captured on Slack. All I need to do is save them. I have a brag doc that I maintain as an email thread. I keep sending mails to that thread with screenshots of messages that highlight my impact, at work or personal life. You don’t need an elaborate brag doc system. Email will do. Or a simple Google doc. I have set expectations with my manager on the following things: my impact(captured through KRs), Feedback from others (360* + my own brag doc), where I map to my company’s career levels, and my long term learnings/growth (based on my manager’s feedback, I keep this decoupled from my current role). Regular 1-1s so that I don’t get last minute surprises. I take just a few hours to write my performance review because of these systems. I wrote feedback for 14 people in last cycle. I could only do it on time because I have a template for that too. Use these systems and you will never have to worry about performance reviews season. Creating systems can also save you a lot of time that you can use to shitpost on Twitter like me.","content_snippet":"Create simple systems | Manas J.

This time around, we have a bit of a different format, featuring the book that started it all for me, The 4-Hour Workweek. Readers and listeners often ask me what I would change or update, but an equally interesting question is: what wouldn’t I change? What stands the test of time and hasn’t lost any potency? This episode features two of the most important chapters from the audiobook of The 4-Hour Workweek. The chapters push you to defend your scarce attention—one by saying no to people, the other by saying no to excess information.Sponsors:David Protein Bars 28g of protein, 150 calories, and 0g of sugar: https://davidprotein.com/tim (Buy 4 cartons, get the 5th free.)Our Place&#x27;s Titanium Always Pan® Pro using nonstick technology that’s coating-free and made without PFAS, otherwise known as “Forever Chemicals”: https://fromourplace.com/tim (Shop their Spring Sale today!)AG1 all-in-one nutritional supplement: https://DrinkAG1.com/Tim (1-year supply of Vitamin D (and 5 free AG1 travel packs) with your first subscription purchase.)Timestamps:[00:00:00] Start.[00:07:24] The low-information diet.[00:09:45] Cultivating selective ignorance.[00:14:32] How to read 200% faster in 10 minutes.[00:17:09] Questions and actions: Go on an immediate one-week media fast.[00:21:05] Develop the habit of asking yourself, “Will I definitely use this information for something immediate and important?”[00:22:03] Practice the art of nonfinishing.[00:22:49] Comfort challenge: Get phone numbers.[00:25:14] Interrupting interruption and the art of refusal.[00:28:16] Not all evils are created equal.[00:29:36] Time wasters: Become an ignoramus.[00:30:09] Limit email consumption and production.[00:33:05] Screen incoming and limit outgoing phone calls.[00:36:10] Master the art of refusal and avoiding meetings.[00:38:33] In order of preference, steer people toward email, phone, and in-person meetings.[00:38:59] Respond to voicemail via email whenever possible.[00:40:50] Meetings should only be held to make decisions about a predefined situation, not to define the problem.[00:41:53] If you absolutely cannot stop a meeting or call from happening, define the end time.[00:43:00] The cubicle is your temple — don’t permit casual visitors.[00:44:24] Use the Puppy Dog Close to help your superiors and others develop the no-meeting habit.[00:46:48] Time consumers: Batch and do not falter.[00:50:05] How much is your time worth?[00:50:45] Estimate the amount of time you will save by grouping similar tasks and batching them.[00:51:14] Determine how much problems cost to fix in each period.[00:53:02] Empowerment failure: Rules and readjustment.[00:59:44] Questions and actions: Create systems to limit your availability.[01:01:55] Batch activities to limit setup cost and provide more time for dreamline milestones.[01:02:25] Set or request autonomous rules and guidelines with occasional review of results.[01:03:18] Tools for eliminating paper distractions, capturing everything.[01:05:28] Tools for screening and avoiding unwanted calls.[01:07:12] Tools for scheduling without back-and-forth.[01:08:23] Tools for choosing the best email batching times.[01:09:13] Tools for emailing without entering the inbox black hole.[01:10:20] Tools for preventing web browsing/internet use.[01:11:10] Comfort challenge: revisit the terrible twos.[01:12:07] Lifestyle design in action.*For show notes and past guests on The Tim Ferriss Show, please visit tim.blog/podcast.For deals from sponsors of The Tim Ferriss Show, please visit tim.blog/podcast-sponsorsSign up for Tim’s email newsletter (5-Bullet Friday) at tim.blog/friday.For transcripts of episodes, go to tim.blog/transcripts.Discover Tim’s books: tim.blog/books.Follow Tim:Twitter: twitter.com/tferriss Instagram: instagram.com/timferrissYouTube: youtube.com/timferrissFacebook: facebook.com/timferriss LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/timferrissPast guests on The Tim Ferriss Show include Jerry Seinfeld, Hugh Jackman, Dr. Jane Goodall, LeBron James, Kevin Hart, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Jamie Foxx, Matthew McConaughey, Esther Perel, Elizabeth Gilbert, Terry Crews, Sia, Yuval Noah Harari, Malcolm Gladwell, Madeleine Albright, Cheryl Strayed, Jim Collins, Mary Karr, Maria Popova, Sam Harris, Michael Phelps, Bob Iger, Edward Norton, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Neil Strauss, Ken Burns, Maria Sharapova, Marc Andreessen, Neil Gaiman, Neil de Grasse Tyson, Jocko Willink, Daniel Ek, Kelly Slater, Dr. Peter Attia, Seth Godin, Howard Marks, Dr. Brené Brown, Eric Schmidt, Michael Lewis, Joe Gebbia, Michael Pollan, Dr. Jordan Peterson, Vince Vaughn, Brian Koppelman, Ramit Sethi, Dax Shepard, Tony Robbins, Jim Dethmer, Dan Harris, Ray Dalio, Naval Ravikant, Vitalik Buterin, Elizabeth Lesser, Amanda Palmer, Katie Haun, Sir Richard Branson, Chuck Palahniuk, Arianna Huffington, Reid Hoffman, Bill Burr, Whitney Cummings, Rick Rubin, Dr. Vivek Murthy, Darren Aronofsky, Margaret Atwood, Mark Zuckerberg, Peter Thiel, Dr. Gabor Maté, Anne Lamott, Sarah Silverman, Dr. Andrew Huberman, and many more.See Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.","content_snippet":"#809: The 4-Hour Workweek Tools That Still Work — The Art of Refusal and The Low-Information Diet -

Professor Nagle studies how competitors can collaborate on the creation of core technologies, while still competing on the products and services built on top of them – especially in the context of artificial intelligence. His research falls into the broader categories of the future of work, the economics of IT, and digital transformation and considers how technology is weakening firm boundaries. His work utilizes large datasets derived from online social networks, open source software repositories, financial market information, and surveys of enterprise IT usage.

Saloi","description":"Use two accounts: main and alt. Alt is actually my wife’s alt that I use because I am too lazy to create another account. Main account is for posting my thoughts. To cut my need to post every thought I have, I have given control of my account to my wife. I don’t even know the password anymore. When I want to post something, I get my wife to login to my account on incognito. The tab remains open till I am done with my tweets and replies. I don’t follow any account or lists on both my main and alt accounts. Why do I even need an alt account? So that I don’t keep tweeting whole day with my main. I don’t care if I spend a few hours on Twitter as long as I don’t spend them arguing with random people who disagree with something I posted. I use Twitter on Chrome. I don’t use the apps. Since I don’t have notifications, I search for my name and my website URL so that I know if someone tagged me or shared something I wrote. I find it polite to reply if someone went out the way to share and comment on something I wrote. I also need to know if some friend tagged me on some funny meme. I have like 5 accounts I search for daily: all meme accounts. I check if they tweeted something new. Then I go to their Likes section for discovery. I wrote about this workflow here. I track my twitter rants in the loop habit tracker app. I feel very happy if I manage to skip tweeting for a day or two. I hate spending so much time on Twitter, but I have to admit I am hooked. I get all the good tweets sent to me by my friends on Whatsapp anyway. So I don’t need to follow people or even maintain lists. If I tweet out more than 5 unrelated tweets/threads in a day, I have to pay my wife 500 bucks. This is the only way I can control myself from not tweeting out every thought that comes to my head.","content_snippet":"Twitter workflow - 2021 | Manas J. Saloi Use two accounts: main and alt.

At the beginning of autumn, the same individuals make a return migration to their breeding grounds to reproduce and die. Here we show that Bogong moths use the starry night sky as a compass to distinguish between specific geographical directions, thereby navigating in their inherited migratory direction towards their distant goal. By tethering spring and autumn migratory moths in a flight simulator3&#8211;5, we found that, under naturalistic moonless night skies and in a nulled geomagnetic field (disabling the moth&#8217;s known magnetic sense4), moths flew in their seasonally appropriate migratory directions. Visual interneurons in different regions of the moth&#8217;s brain responded specifically to rotations of the night sky and were tuned to a common sky orientation, firing maximally when the moth was headed southwards. Our results suggest that Bogong moths use stellar cues and the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field to create a robust compass system for long-distance nocturnal navigation towards a specific destination. Every spring, Bogong moths use the starry night sky as a compass to navigate up to 1,000&#8201;km towards their alpine migratory goal.","content_snippet":"Bogong moths use a stellar compass for long-distance navigation at night | Nature Skip to main conte"},"e74e0026394972a62086ff2544bb084b":{"url":"https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/participants","title":"Google Season of Docs &nbsp;|&nbsp; Google for Developers","description":"","content_snippet":"Google Season of Docs | Google for Developers Skip to main content Google Season of Docs / English D"},"e75059ff56fcda792c826b9baff8e3fc":{"url":"https://www.newyorker.com/puzzles-and-games-dept/name-drop/random","title":"Play Name Drop, The New Yorker’s Trivia Game: Tuesday, September 21, 2021 | The New Yorker","description":"Can you guess the identity of a notable person—contemporary or historical—in six clues?","content_snippet":"Play Name Drop, The New Yorker’s Trivia Game: Tuesday, September 21, 2021 | The New YorkerSkip to ma"},"e751f6cdc81c13d8ea03dc39fd39d0f2":{"url":"https://paulgraham.com/jessica.html","title":"Jessica Livingston","description":"","content_snippet":"Jessica Livingston November 2015A few months ago an article about Y Combinator said that early on it"},"e7550a955fcef8e784cb3c46318518d9":{"url":"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/","title":"Core Contributor Handbook &#8211; Make WordPress Core","description":"Welcome to the Core Contributor Handbook, the place to learn how to get involved with the WordPress core development community, and start contributing to WordPress core.

At The Verge, we’re exploring what might be possible with AI — and a lot of the bad stuff AI does, too.","content_snippet":"Artificial Intelligence | The VergeSkip to main contentThe homepageThe VergeThe Verge logo.The homep"},"e9ed74cc13289d9ea0f92fba374a4bea":{"url":"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials","title":"Tutorials | DigitalOcean","description":"Follow along with one of our 8,000+ development and sysadmin tutorials.","content_snippet":"Tutorials | DigitalOceanAll topics tagsEnjoy $200 to try DigitalOceanClick below for $200 of free cr"},"e9f79b11ea2c3b42c035c11c320abbb2":{"url":"https://www.economist.com/special-report/2025/06/05/sources-and-acknowledgments","title":"Sources and acknowledgments","description":"Special report","content_snippet":"Sources and acknowledgmentsMy EconomistUnlimited digital access to all reporting, podcasts, newslett"},"ea04b4612237961491dc0636a2a18c35":{"url":"https://betterprogramming.pub/@laurabrewis95","title":"Laura Brewis – Medium","description":"Read writing from Laura Brewis on Medium.

By focusing on the value of the output that AI produces, however, we tend not to think much about other sources of value. We rarely ask: In what way does each activity we do create true and unique value? It’s time for leaders to take a cold, hard look at their organizations and ask that question so they don’t destroy more value than they create in adopting gen AI. An AI value audit can help leaders make an objective and holistic assessment of benefits and costs.","content_snippet":"Recalculating the Costs and Benefits of Gen AISKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoGenerative "},"ea5dbfe66a54427c1e1730756c434405":{"url":"https://code.facebook.com/get-involved","title":"Page not found - Engineering at Meta","description":"","content_snippet":"Page not found - Engineering at Meta Skip to content We recently migrated the Code engineering blog."},"ea6e93c1d996655e938d566728de51b1":{"url":"https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/04/24/how-regular-expressions-go-fast/","title":"you can take the derivative of a regular expression?!","description":"you can take the derivative of a regular expression?!","content_snippet":"you can take the derivative of a regular expression?!

Third, set boundaries, even if it makes others unhappy. Finally, define times where you’ll be really “on”—and really “off.”","content_snippet":"Is Your Flexible Schedule Burning You Out?SKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoFlex timeIs You"},"ee2d01b03e35c54e912f03de0625990a":{"url":"https://lwn.net/Articles/756565/","title":"Will staging lose its Lustre?

The rare ability to balance continuity and change–requiring a consciously practiced discipline–is closely linked to the ability to develop a vision. Vision provides guidance about what to preserve and what to change. A new prescriptive framework adds clarity and rigor to the vague and fuzzy vision concepts at large today. The framework has two principal parts: core ideology and envisioned future. Core ideology combines an organization’s core values and core purpose. It’s the glue that holds a company together as it grows and changes. Core values are an organization’s essential and enduring tenets–the values it would hold even if they became a competitive disadvantage; core purpose is the organization’s fundamental reason for being. The second component of the vision framework is the envisioned future. First, a company must identify bold stretch goals; then it should articulate vivid descriptions of what it will mean to achieve them. Henry Ford set the goal of democratizing the automobile, then told the world, “When I’m through…everyone will have one. The horse will have disappeared from our highways”–an imaginative stretch for the time. Unfortunately, the usual vision statement is fuzzy and inspires only boredom. But managers who master a discovery process to identify core ideology can link their vision statements to the fundamental dynamic that motivates truly visionary companies–that is, the dynamic of preserving the core and stimulating progress.","content_snippet":"Building Your Company’s VisionSKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoLeadership visionBuilding Y"},"f033976dc40c82f3330a806612f70846":{"url":"https://www.phoronix.com/forums/node/1555486","title":"RADV Vulkan Driver Lands Some &quot;Random Bits &amp; Pieces&quot; For CDNA Accelerators - Phoronix Forums","description":"Phoronix: RADV Vulkan Driver Lands Some &amp;quot;Random Bits &amp;amp; Pieces&amp;quot; For CDNA Accelerators The RADV open-source Radeon Vulkan driver within Mesa supports GFX9/Vega graphics cards but not the later CDNA-based Instinct accelerators.

They’ve spent more effort on innovating than on anticipating how customers—and bad actors—might engage with products. But as digital products become a primary way in which consumers connect with others, pay for things, and store private information, that view needs to change. The authors contend that companies must embed safeguards into the core of their digital products—starting during the earliest parts of the design process. They must also establish a road map for continued improvement and a dialogue with customers. The safety-by-design model can facilitate innovation rather than constrain it by providing a principled approach to product development.","content_snippet":"Balancing Digital Safety and InnovationSKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoProduct developmen"},"f2299d14247efbffb21ab14d0e381fe6":{"url":"https://www.infoq.com/javascript/","title":"Javascript - InfoQ","description":"Hands-on Vue.js, Reactive, Typescript, and more.","content_snippet":"Javascript - InfoQ BT InfoQ Software Architects' Newsletter A monthly overview of things you need to"},"f2311844b971a9ee429485124ec9f181":{"url":"https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/pragmatic-engineer-test/","title":"The Pragmatic Engineer Test: 12 Questions on Engineering Culture - The Pragmatic Engineer","description":"","content_snippet":"The Pragmatic Engineer Test: 12 Questions on Engineering Culture - The Pragmatic Engineer Menu Close"},"f244e8c94d75880b5ecf35da9a124056":{"url":"https://itsfoss.com/tag/newsletter/","title":"Newsletter ✉️ - It&#x27;s FOSS","description":"","content_snippet":"Newsletter ✉️ - It's FOSS Log in Subscribe Newsletter ✉️ 124 posts FOSS Weekly #25.25: Nitrux Hyprla"},"f248a7c8afc6682563a5b1104eef6355":{"url":"https://www.linuxfoundation.org/webinars/kernel-livepatching-hands-on?hsLang=en","title":"Kernel Livepatching: Hands On","description":"Get insights from the best open source projects and people.

By contrast, fossil evidence attests to earlier migrations out of Africa10&#8211;15. These lines of evidence can only be reconciled if early dispersals made little to no genetic contribution to the later, major wave. A key question therefore concerns what factors facilitated the successful later dispersal that led to long-term settlement beyond Africa. Here we show that a notable expansion in human niche breadth within Africa precedes this later dispersal. We assembled a pan-African database of chronometrically dated archaeological sites and used species distribution models (SDMs) to quantify changes in the bioclimatic niche over the past 120,000&#8201;years. We found that the human niche began to expand substantially from 70&#8201;ka and that this expansion was driven by humans increasing their use of diverse habitat types, from forests to arid deserts. Thus, humans dispersing out of Africa after 50&#8201;ka were equipped with a distinctive ecological flexibility among hominins as they encountered climatically challenging habitats, providing a key mechanism for their adaptive success. Analysis of species distribution models in a pan-African database comprising chronometrically dated archaeological sites over the past 120,000&#8201;years shows major expansion in the human niche from 70&#8201;ka, driven by adaptation to diverse habitats.","content_snippet":"Major expansion in the human niche preceded out of Africa dispersal | Nature Skip to main content Th"},"f288e92ad2a71e57a7bfb8f861890076":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_States","title":"Taxation in the United States - Wikipedia","description":"","content_snippet":"Taxation in the United States - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Unit"},"f28a297aa83c7d47693f29f11dcb0a6d":{"url":"https://www.economist.com/topics/africa","title":"Africa | Latest news and analysis from The Economist","description":"Explore our coverage of Africa’s politics, economics, business and culture, in articles, charts, podcasts and video","content_snippet":"Africa | Latest news and analysis from The EconomistMy EconomistUnlimited digital access to all repo"},"f291607aba6fb58dc3ef155ad08de445":{"url":"https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/","title":"WP-CLI Commands | Developer.WordPress.org","description":"Documentation for all currently available WP-CLI commands, including usage and subcommands.","content_snippet":"WP-CLI Commands | Developer.WordPress.org WordPress.org WordPress Developer Resources Search WP-CLI "},"f298880f67e576eb68021ed9525754df":{"url":"https://www.themarginalian.org/almanac-of-birds/","title":"An Almanac of Birds: 100 Divinations for Uncertain Days &#8211; The Marginalian","description":"","content_snippet":"An Almanac of Birds: 100 Divinations for Uncertain Days – The Marginalian Every month, I spend hundr"},"f2991de14c84a78b983d71eaa074cf23":{"url":"https://opensource.googleblog.com/2017/06/","title":"Google Open Source Blog: June 2017","description":"","content_snippet":"Google Open Source Blog: June 2017 Google Open Source Blog The latest news from Google on open sourc"},"f29aa44dc01487e596f390e534830cb5":{"url":"https://sharptech.fm/member/episode/meta-continues-its-ai-spending-spree-more-fun-with-open-ai-and-microsoft-apple-in-china-and-related-matters","title":"Sharp Tech","description":"Sharp Tech - How technology works, and the ways it is impacting the world","content_snippet":"Sharp TechYou need to enable JavaScript to run this app...."},"f29b7c39de3736e3b8612848d9d92cd8":{"url":"https://waitbutwhy.com","title":"Wait But Why","description":"A popular long-form, stick-figure-illustrated blog about almost everything.","content_snippet":"Wait But Why BREAKING NEWS: Go read my new book.

A $100 million revenue stream won’t add much value to OpenAI, which is already valued at $300B. While the Windsurf team is certainly talented and acquiring them is beneficial, I believe the main reason is that while OpenAI has become the default application for general chat, they’re lagging behind Claude and the rapidly improving Gemini models when it comes to coding capabilities.","content_snippet":"OpenAI buys Windsurf | Manas J.

Strategies that can rapidly introduce diverse vicinal substituents to readily available precursors would greatly benefit generation of analogues of bioactive compounds2, which, however, remain challenging to realize to date. The existing approaches for preparing vicinal difunctionalized arenes lack modularity, or regioselectivity, or generality. Here we report a nickel-catalyzed vicinal diborylation method that can directly install two chemically differentiated boryl groups in a regio- and site-selective manner using readily available aryl triflates or chlorides as substrates. This reaction operates under simple and mild conditions and is scalable. It also shows a broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. Given that each boryl group can be independently transformed into various functional groups, this method offers a modular, regioselective, and divergent approach to access diverse vicinal difunctionalized arenes, showing promise for constructing analogue libraries. The combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies reveal a highly unusual reaction pathway, involving the formation of a dearomatized gem-diboryl species and 1,2-boron migration. The site- and regioselectivity of this reaction are proposed to be controlled by steric interactions of the boryl groups with the nickel catalyst. The mechanistic insights gained in this investigation could have broad implications on developing other boron-mediated functionalization reactions.","content_snippet":"Modular arene functionalization by differential 1,2-diborylation | Nature Skip to main content Thank"},"f8714291c123427f1d738e1634d5cc31":{"url":"https://manassaloi.com/2022/01/21/the-price.html","title":"The price we pay | Manas J.

The industry is moving from hardware to software in the form of smart, connected elevators. But instead of laying off legacy hardware staff and hiring new talent, the CEO wants to offer the employees a “Grand Bargain”: The company will pay for voluntary reskilling and retraining, but the workers will need to take responsibility for their own futures. Those who opt in will gain valuable skills and have a future with the company; those who don’t may face demotions and pay cuts. However, there is pushback from the company’s shareholders and leaders. Some want to use the program as a fig leaf for laying off staff; others think it costs too much and might put the company at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies that are hiring technologically skilled people right away. Leaders are worried that longtime workers will balk at learning these new skills and end up quitting, causing the company to lose hundreds of years of cumulative experience. The CEO is now unsure of how to proceed.","content_snippet":"Case Study: Do We Reskill or Replace Our Workforce?SKIP TO CONTENTHarvard Business Review LogoChange"},"fb01e1d3855629df2c184130910f3d05":{"url":"https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2023/7/6/how-to-blow-up-a-timeline","title":"How to Blow Up a Timeline &mdash; Remains of the Day","description":"","content_snippet":"How to Blow Up a Timeline — Remains of the Day NOTE: I’d been working on this piece on and off for a"},"fb1023c38033fafa14ec059ede3e21d2":{"url":"https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/how-microsoft-does-qa/","title":"How Microsoft does Quality Assurance (QA) - The Pragmatic Engineer","description":"The Redmond Big Tech giant pioneered the SDET role in the 90s.

Saloi","description":"A few days ago, I was thinking about how pricing works for software products, especially in tools like Devin that depend heavily on AI. It’s not the same as something like Figma, where the cost of serving an incremental user is pretty negligible. Once you’ve built the product and infrastructure, every new user is just another account on the system—there’s no real extra cost. That’s why I’ve been hoping Figma introduces regional pricing at some point. Right now, a lot of people in regions with lower purchasing power are likely to churn to cheaper alternatives like Sketch or Penpot. If Figma doesn’t adapt, it feels inevitable.","content_snippet":"Figma vs Devin pricing | Manas J.

In the past, I have tried editing workflows for turning my Twitter thoughts into blog posts, but most models would just rewrite the entire post. It wouldn’t sound like me, how I write, and people would easily tell it was written by AI, even though most of the ideas were my own thoughts. But this prompt is a bit different. It would just fix typos and grammar, add transition words, and if there are redundant words, it would remove them. Sometimes it makes mistakes. For example, when I wrote a post about AI funding in India, there was a line about Donald Trump, and it rewrote that line to suggest Donald Trump was not the president, which was pretty suspicious. And for the first time, someone asked if I use ChatGPT to write, which I wasn’t. I know an easier way would be to finally read books like Word Power Made Easy and Wren and Martin, but let’s face it, I’m too old now. And I am way too lazy to improve my writing. Okay, now back to the main point.","content_snippet":"Should ChatGPT allow pinned chats? | Manas J.

Saloi","description":"“Three categories of AI startups. This actually is a framework that came in the mobile revolution for us at Spark, and then reapplied. So this is an old lens, reapplied, which is adaptation, evolution, and revolution. And there are versions of this that have existed as people have talked about AI generally. But for us, can I use a mobile analogy to kind of get you there? Yeah. Adaptation is the obvious, like, I’m going to take the thing, and I’m going to make a copy of the thing for AI. And so in the mobile revolution, this was the New York Times makes NewYorkTimes.com on mobile. And that’s the product, right? And that’s obviously a world where 2023 was kind of the big adaptation push. And that was when Adobe Firefly launches. It’s when Spotify DJ launches. It’s when Canva Create, I think it’s called. It’s when, like, you know, the big boys came to town with their AI products. And everybody had, like, a year to go think about what they were going to do after the GPT era. And, like, ship their incumbent advantage stuff. Like, that’s all adaptation. Evolution, I think the easiest way to kind of separate it is it’s when there’s a new workflow. It’s when the behavior has changed slightly. And so the good example of this is in the mobile era is Instagram, where you’re suddenly doing a different behavior than you used to when you think about Flickr or prior photo websites. It’s a new behavior that is native to that medium. Today, you think about things like this can be done by incumbents and by startups, by the way. Like, sometimes a really fast-moving startup will do it. Sometimes it’s an incumbent. Granola is a good example of this, right? They are an evolved product. You are treating, I don’t know if you want to call that an AI meeting note software. I don’t know if you want to call it transcription software. I don’t want to call it just Apple Notes with AI in it. But it’s a different behavior. It’s a different way of using the product. I think Replit agents, the way that they’ve rebuilt, have a really good example of evolving the medium in a way. Descript is another example. Like, you cannot take the incumbent UI and just slap Descript on. It is a rethinking of how you would do audio and video editing from scratch with AI in mind, right? So that’s evolution. And then the last one, revolution, like this is the canonical, like I’m sure this gets talked about every week on your podcast, but this is Uber, right? This is like it’s an entirely new platform that would only exist because this technology exists. Where do we have the most and where do we have the least? You mean today in the market? Today in the market? Oh. I mean, we are in the industrialization of startups playbook land where everybody is trying to churn out some piece of ridiculous arbitrage every week in order to get to the end of your incubator and raise their seed round. So we mostly have evolved products that are not good enough or we have adapted products with a coat of paint on top that says AI. What do you find most interesting? When we invest, most of our largest exits at Spark over time and most of my most satisfying work over time has been on the revolution and sometimes the evolution category. So we have no desire to invest in anything that’s an adaptation. We’re trying to lean towards the more disruptive, the higher risk, knowing that that won’t always work out, but at least it’s a journey worth traveling. ”","content_snippet":"Three categories of AI startups | Manas J.
