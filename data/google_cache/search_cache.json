However, it has been widely recognized that regularly drinking two or three coffees per day provides several health benefits. Nevertheless, the total intake in healthy compounds is largely affected by several variables among which the roasting, the grinding and the brewing method are the most important. On these pillars we have analyzed the effect of roasting, grinding and three brewing methods on the content in phenols, caffeine and antioxidants of coffee samples. Methods: Three roasting degrees (light, medium and dark) and three grinding levels (fine, fine-coarse and coarse) were used to prepare Espresso, American and Turkish coffee samples for a total of 27 experimental conditions. Physical and chemical analyses as well as caffeine content, polyphenols and antioxidant activity were analyzed for each experimental condition. Results: As effect of roasting, the antioxidant activity of coffee brew increased due to melanoidins produced at high temperature while the ‘native’ polyphenols of the green beans were significantly lost during roasting. Grinding level affected the kinetic extraction more than pressure, dose and particle size although a significant variation was always observed. As consequence regular espresso of 25 mL may contain from 80 to 120 mg of caffeine depending of the variance in grinding process. Overall, a regular cup (200 mL) of American coffee resulted to contain average values of 280-350 mg of caffeine, 500-1200 mg of gallic acid and 500-1200 mg trolox. Conclusion: American coffee was the richest in caffeine, polyphenols and antioxidant activity when considering a regular coffee commonly consumed at bar. A more precise standardization of the grinding, when consuming coffee at bar, is one of the most important future step to tackle the wide variability in quality estimated among repeated coffees.", "content_snippet": "Background: The coffee drinking habits strongly vary as effect of several points, such as culture, lifestyle, social behavior, preferences, and economic aspects.

Birth control policies and entrenched patriarchal norms have contributed to a highly imbalanced male/female ratio in India. While the impact of son preference on the sex ratio is largely studied, the consequences of a male-skewed sex ratio on women’s fertility preferences remain underexplored. Merging different longitudinal datasets (Indian Census and IHDS panel household survey), this article provides an original empirical analysis of the effect of district-level sex ratios on women’s fertility preferences and the nested pathways of this relationship. Individual and time fixed-effects regressions show that district-level surplus of men negatively affects women’s desired number of sons. The robustness of these findings is confirmed after conducting multiple checks, including controlling for endogeneity by leveraging temperature data from the India meteorological department (1952–2011). The investigation of potential pathways shows that a higher district male/female ratio may make gender norms and the marriage market more favorable to women (via an increase in decision-making power and age of marriage, and a decrease in the dowry price and domestic violence acceptance).

Theoretically, populations of sexual organisms investing half of their resources into producing male offspring that don&#8217;t contribute to reproduction should grow at only half the rate of their asexual counterparts. This demographic disadvantage due to male production is known as the twofold cost of sex. However, the question of whether this cost is truly twofold for sexual females remains unanswered. The cost of producing males should decrease when the number of male offspring is reduced. Here, we report a case where the cost of males is actually less than twofold. By measuring the numbers of sexual strain coexisting with asexual strain among thrips, our survey revealed that the sexual strain showed female-biased sex ratios and that the relative frequency of sexual strain is negatively correlated with the proportion of males in the sexual strain. Using computer simulations, we confirmed that a female-biased sex ratio evolves in sexual individuals due to the coexistence of asexual individuals.
